            "description": "The British-Iranian woman faces new charges, a week after being freed from a five-year prison term.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has appeared in court in Iran, a week after her ankle tag was removed having served five years in prison, her lawyer said.\n\nThe British-Iranian charity worker was ordered to appear on charges of propaganda against the regime.\n\nThe judge told her to expect a verdict within seven working days, according to the Free Nazanin campaign.\n\nHer husband Richard said the British embassy in Tehran had declined to accompany his wife to Sunday's trial.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed in 2016 for allegedly working against the Iranian government, which she has always denied.\n\nAccording to her lawyer, she was accused in Sunday's hearing of participating in a demonstration outside the Iranian embassy in London 12 years ago and giving an interview to the BBC Persian service, said BBC correspondent Caroline Hawley.\n\nHer lawyer said the atmosphere in court had been calm and he hoped she would be acquitted because she has already served five years on a more serious charge.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab called it \"unacceptable and unjustifiable\" that Iran has chosen to continue with the second \"wholly arbitrary\" case, saying the Iranian government has \"deliberately put her through a cruel and inhumane ordeal\".\n\nHe added: \"Nazanin must be allowed to return to her family in the UK without further delay. We continue to do all we can to support her.\"\n\nThere is a good reason why Richard Ratcliffe describes his wife as a \"pawn\" in a game of chess, a bargaining chip. And she's not alone.\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - together with several other dual nationals from a range of countries - is caught up in the middle of some complicated geopolitics.\n\nThe backdrop to her case is the West's difficult relationship with Iran, and a growing emphasis by Iran on \"hostage diplomacy\".\n\nThe charity worker was told explicitly that her imprisonment was linked to a \u00a3400m debt owed by Britain for an arms deal to Iran that was done before she was even born.\n\nIn the days of the Shah, Iran had bought tanks from Britain but, after the 1979 Revolution, they were not delivered.\n\nThe UK and Iran have been haggling in court over interest on the debt for years. And when UK PM Boris Johnson spoke by phone to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last week to demand Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, the Iranian president apparently complained that no \"practical progress\" had been made by the UK to repay the debt.\n\nWhatever happens in the courts, the message from Iran seems to be, if not loud, at least pretty clear.\n\nMuch less clear is when her ordeal will be over.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, Labour's Tulip Siddiq, said she was \"deeply concerned about the possible outcome\" and said the anxiety of waiting for a verdict will \"just add to her ongoing mental torture\".\n\nShe also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not being \"capable of ensuring that British officials attended her court hearing to ensure a fair trial\".\n\nMs Siddiq said: \"Now is the time to bring Nazanin home to the UK, and our government has a responsibility to pull every possible lever to make that happen.\"\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family fear the court case could be used to block her return to the UK because the Iranian government wants to keep her for diplomatic leverage.\n\nMr Johnson has called for her \"immediate release\".\n\nEarlier, Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been due to report to court at 09:00 Iranian time (05:30 GMT), but did not know when her trial would be heard, what it would entail or how long it would be.\n\nShe was expected to appear in the Revolutionary Court, in front of the same judge who conducted her earlier hearings.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Ratcliffe said that neither he nor his wife had any idea what to expect. \"It's like trying to read tea leaves,\" he said.\n\n\"The charges are irrelevant. This is not a real court process. This is not a fair trial - it's an act of abuse.\n\n\"Nazanin is now pretty stressed. She is extremely twitchy, restless and agitated.\"\n\nMr Ratcliffe had hoped the British ambassador would accompany his wife to the trial, but said the British embassy in Tehran had declined.\n\n\"I am disappointed that the embassy has declined to accompany Nazanin to the Revolutionary Court,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"To my mind, it is a missed opportunity to protect her, a missed opportunity to stand up for her as British, and it is not the first. I hope that timidity is not a choice that we come to regret.\"\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it had formally requested access to the hearing.\n\nAmnesty International UK said it was disappointed UK officials did not attend Sunday's hearing \"to show Nazanin the kind of support she needs and is entitled to\".\n\nDirector Kate Allen added: \"One trumped-up case against Nazanin was bad enough - a second one is an act of cruelty.\"\n\nThe case comes after a charity warned in a medical report sent to the UK government that the 43-year-old was suffering from major depression and PTSD and was in need of urgent treatment.\n\nThe report, commissioned by the human rights charity Redress, said she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence.\n\nBefore her ankle tag was recently removed, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March due to the coronavirus crisis.",

            "content": "The grounds of Cardiff Castle were opened for socially distanced picnics last summer\n\nCities, towns and villages must be redesigned to improve access to nature in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, campaigners have said.\n\nThe future generations commissioner wants everyone to have a public green space within four minute's walk.\n\nDuring the first lockdown one in eight households in Wales did not have access to a garden, yard or balcony, official statistics show.\n\nThe Welsh government has committed \u00a3110m to transforming towns in Wales.\n\nPlanning experts and designers said the pandemic was a \"profound opportunity\" to rethink communities to tackle climate change and health issues.\n\nIdeas include planting trees, more cycle routes, reopening disused railway lines, creating \"pocket\" parks, and a campaign to create neighbourhoods where everything needed is within a 20-minute walk.\n\nSophie Howe said access to green spaces should be a right for everyone\n\nFuture generations commissioner Sophie Howe said public green spaces had been a \"lifeline\" for many during lockdowns and were vital for physical and mental health.\n\nMs Howe wants to see changes to towns, cities and villages, to make sure no-one in Wales lives more than four minutes' walk - about 330yds or 300m - from a public green space.\n\nShe said people who did not have a garden were reliant on being able to access open public spaces - but many had struggled to do that due to travel restrictions.\n\n\"It shouldn't be based on where you live, and the price of your house, it should be a right for everyone,\" said Ms Howe.\n\nThe Welsh Government said its local places nature fund had created more than 400 wildlife gardens in and around residential areas in the past year.\n\nSome people set up \"fairy homes\" in woods during the first lockdown\n\nIt is almost a year since Wales was first placed under lockdown, with people only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including to exercise.\n\nWhile about a fifth of Wales is covered by national parks, the mountains and coastlines have been off-limits during lockdowns to all but those who live on their doorsteps.\n\nHow much of the country do parks, fields and public gardens make up (not including National Parks)?\n\u2022 None 10,000 areasof accessible public green spaces, such as parks, fields and gardens\n\u2022 None Less than 1% of Wales is made up of publically accessible green space\n\u2022 None 3.61public green spaces on average in a 1,000m radius of homes\n\nAt the start of the first lockdown, official figures showed 133,542 Welsh households did not have access to a private outdoor space.\n\nThis is the equivalent of 9% of households in Wales, according to Office for National Statistics figures.\n\nThe data also shows at least 36% of those living in flats in Wales did not have access to a private space, a higher rate than in England or Scotland.\n\nMore than 17,000 people on the shielding list, who were told not to leave their homes, had no access to any outdoor space.\n\nSome councils are investing more in improving green spaces, while others have reported conflict as more people use footpaths.\n\nIn Cardiff, the council is planning to spend around \u00a32m improving green spaces, parks and pavements in 2021-22.\n\nWhile in Rhondda Cynon Taf, the council said a significant increase in people using footpaths had led to a number of landowners \"taking matters into their own hands\" and closing paths.\n\nMeanwhile in Swansea, the council and Natural Resources Wales are ploughing ahead with plans to double the city's green space, including building the first park in the city since Victorian times.\n\nIn many towns and cities, Covid forced adaptations, with one-way systems in high streets and more space for outside seating.\n\nWhile some of the measures were divisive - limiting parking and delivery spaces or shutting major roads - there were other calls to make them permanent.\n\nNot-for-profit group For Cardiff, which represents more than 700 businesses, said with more people set to work from home in the long term, changes had to be made to draw people into the city.\n\nAdrian Field, executive director, said having more outdoor seating had allowed many businesses to survive and the group was looking at whether a new public space could be opened.\n\n\"It might have entertainment... PE equipment or a big screen to watch films or sporting events... there is an eagerness for that space to be used,\" he said.\n\n\"I think all towns and cities need to create environments where people can linger, interact, exercise... hopefully that includes pocket parks, if we can get more tables and chairs outside I think there will be a lot of demand long term.\"\n\nCharity Sustrans said despite efforts, no area in Wales had been designated an official 20-minute neighbourhood in Wales - where every facility is within a 10-minute bike ride or walk of their home.\n\nOne major issue planners have been looking at is how to connect rural communities which may have been cut off from neighbours in lockdown.\n\nSarah Featherstone, of consultants VeloCity, hopes villages can be linked up using footpaths and cycle routes to create \"villages in a garden\".\n\n\"We call it the big back garden,\" said the Brecon-based architect.\n\nShe said while there was a housing crisis, sprawling development meant many were now having to get in their cars to get to the middle of their village to access shops.\n\nHer vision is for the area to be used for people to grow food and for community gardens, while villages would pool together to address issues like poorly maintained pavements, pot holes and reducing speed limits.\n\nParks have seen increased numbers of walkers, cyclists and runners\n\n\"All of the traffic has been pushed to the edges, so that you have this much safer, greener landscape between the villages that can be safeguarded and used for leisure,\" she said.\n\nMs Featherstone said changing planning laws and addressing infrastructure could allow more people to move out of flats in cities to live and work in rural communities.\n\n\"There's a potential for a fresh look at things, but we need to keep that momentum going, otherwise we could easily slip back into jumping back in cars again,\" she said.\n\nThe Welsh government said more than \u00a350m had been allocated for permanent and temporary improvements to walking and cycling routes routes \"to allow people to safely and conveniently travel\" to local destinations, including outdoor spaces.\n\nLast year a spike in Covid cases in valleys communities was partly blamed by some on the design of the areas, with tightly packed lines of terraced houses.\n\nIn Merthyr Tydfil - which in November had the highest Covid case rate in the UK - the council kept parks open during the firebreak lockdown, as the Brecon Beacons national park was just out of reach for many.\n\nThere are also thoughts on how south Wales valley communities could be reimagined and opened up with more access to green spaces.\n\nMatthew Jones said the recovery post-Covid was an opportunity to \"profoundly change\" towns, as more people worked from home and had developed an appreciation for local shops, paths and parks.\n\n\"There's a potential to really rethink what we do with public spaces... how streets connect together, how people can move safely around where they live,\" he said.\n\nDr Jones, who has looked at the future of towns for the Design Commission for Wales, said homes and workspaces could be redesigned to include garden elements.\n\nPlanners believe more buildings with green spaces built in could appear, like these plans in Swansea\n\nIn Swansea, plans have been approved for a \"living\" building, with rooftop gardens and allotments, and Dr Jones said ideas like this could help towards a bid for Wales to have carbon neutral emissions by 2050.\n\nHe said it would be interesting to see which communities chose to keep temporary measures - such as shutting roads and widening pavements - to create more room for walking and cycling once the pandemic ended.\n\nThe Welsh government said it was already delivering green infrastructure schemes worth \u00a39m to make town centres \"greener, more attractive and safer\".\n\nIt has also launched a national forest programme to create a \"connected woodland extending the length of Wales\".\n\nIn the first year of the programme, projects included more than 20 small woodlands created by and for schoolchildren.",

This year, they're being charged anywhere between $7,000 and $10,000.\n\n\"Some have even been quoted up to $17,000 to bring one container over,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money programme.\n\nIkea says the shortages have been caused by both a huge rise in demand through the pandemic, as people spend more time at home, and problems with its global supply chain.\n\nHowever, the retail giant says it hopes to have things back to normal by the time its stores re-open.\n\nRob Mead is a consultant at White Stores, which sells garden furniture online and from its six shops. The company also has a wholesale arm, Nova, which sells to other retailers.\n\nHe said that his company spent a month negotiating with freight forwarders last November.\n\n\"We did it to get something in place because we can't afford to ship containers at $8,000 to $10,000 a go,\" he said.\n\nProblems with supply could have a knock-on effect on prices, he added.\n\n\"The problem it causes is that it increases the cost price of a product,\" said Mr Mead.\n\n\"You can't just increase your price due to the fact that you're paying more to ship the product - that doesn't improve the quality of the item itself.\"\n\nYou can listen to the Wake Up To Money podcast here.",

            "content": "Hospitality leaders have urged the Scottish government to change its Covid lockdown levels to stop businesses failing.\n\nAn industry group has submitted its own version of the system to ministers.\n\nThe document, seen by the BBC, urges ministers to mirror the plans for England - extending opening times and naming dates.\n\nThe Scottish government said lockdown exit will be driven by data, not dates.\n\nFive of Scotland's main hospitality trade bodies said if changes are implemented, 60,000 jobs in the sector could be saved.\n\nAnalysis was commissioned by the Scottish Hospitality Group, UK Hospitality Scotland, Scottish Licensed Trade Association, Night Time Industries Association and the Scottish Beer and Pub Association.\n\nThey said that under current level three restrictions almost half of hospitality businesses could operate. But if changes are made, this increases to almost three quarters.\n\nUnder the previous level three rules, alcohol was not allowed to be served. But the industry is lobbying for it to be sold outdoors, or indoors with a meal.\n\nOn closing times, the last entry was 17:00 with venues were to close by 18:00. The industry would like to see two-hour time slots for indoor customers, with closing time at 22:30. Outdoors it wants a 23:30 close.\n\nIt claims this could contribute more than \u00a31.2bn to the economy in the short term.\n\nMichael Grieve, chairman of Night Time Industries Association Scotland and owner of Glasgow's Sub Club, told BBC's The Sunday Show that indicative dates would be vitally important to businesses like his.\n\nHe said: \"What we're asking for is that all restrictions are removed at level zero and things return to normal.\n\n\"We think it's imperative that there's a date put against that as a best case scenario as a date to work towards.\n\n\"But we need to have some kind of framework there because at the moment we're completely running blind here - we have no idea when we'll be able to operate.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has said that the previous levels system will be updated to account for changes in the situation - for example, the new variant of coronavirus and the rollout of the vaccination programme.\n\nMichael Grieve added: \"The positive impact of adopting our proposed plan are huge for relatively minor tweaks.\n\n\"We're not going to achieve zero Covid. We need to accept that Covid is in society.\n\n\"So, with vaccination being rolled out... we see no reason why in parallel indicative dates can't be put in place to give the industry some hope that we can reopen and that life can start to return to some kind of normal.\"\n\nThe Scottish government said it understood the desire for certainty for all sectors of the economy.\n\nIt said in a statement: \"We need to be driven by data not dates, and we are regrettably not able to provide fixed dates as to when nightclubs and theatres which involve large audiences and customers in enclosed spaces can reopen.\n\n\"We will continue to listen to the needs of the sector and do everything within our powers to support them through this on-going crisis.\"\n\nIt said work was underway to develop a route-map towards an incremental and cautious re-opening of live events and performances.\n\nThe Scottish government said more than \u00a3140m of additional Covid funding to support culture and heritage in Scotland had been allocated, with more than \u00a33bn in support for business since the start of the pandemic.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The Army is likely to find itself \"outgunned\" in any conflict with Russian forces, MPs have warned.\n\nIn a damning report, the Commons Defence Committee described efforts to modernise the Army's fleet of Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) as \"woeful\".\n\nThe ageing and depleted fleet puts the Army at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by adversaries, it states.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has promised \"an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats\".\n\nIn the report - entitled Obsolescent and Outgunned - the committee highlighted the \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" which had \"bedevilled\" attempts to re-equip the Army over the past two decades.\n\nIn 1990, the UK had around 1,200 main battle tanks in its inventory - today it has 227, the report states. It said armoured vehicle capability had reached \"a point of batch obsolescence, falling behind that of our allies and potential adversaries\".\n\n\"The Army's Armoured Fighting Vehicle programme has been plagued with uncertainties,\" said Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood.\n\n\"The decision to invest in fighting vehicles is too often hampered by uncertainties over what the Army wants them for and pitted against the desire to fund other defence priorities,\" the Conservative MP added, a reference to the government's clear intention to move from industrial age to information-era technology.\n\nThe report comes ahead of publication of the government's Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy, which will be set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday.\n\nDescribed as the most important defence review since the end of the Cold War, it is expected to focus on developing new technology such as robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber.\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"We thank the Defence Committee for their report and acknowledge their recommendations as we look to improve the management of our large and complex equipment programmes.\n\n\"Aided by the substantial \u00a324bn settlement for defence, the Integrated Review will provide resources to deliver an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats.\"\n\nA defence review, due to be published shortly, will promise to transform and modernise Britain's armed forces to fight the wars of the future.\n\nBut this report raises serious questions as to whether the Ministry of Defence can actually deliver.\n\nMPs describe the MoD and specifically the British army's efforts to modernise its ageing fleet of armoured vehicles as \"a woeful story of bureaucratic procrastination, military indecision, financial mismanagement and general ineptitude\".\n\nHundreds of millions of pounds have been \"squandered\" with little to show for it.\n\nIt's left the Army with tanks and armoured vehicles outmatched and outgunned by a peer adversary like Russia.\n\nTo modernise its tanks, the Army will have to significantly cut numbers. Some programmes, like the upgrade to hundreds of Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles, are likely to be scrapped altogether.\n\nThe MoD says the defence review will \"deliver an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats\".\n\nMPs are not so sure. They say the Army's armoured capabilities are \"at risk of being denuded on the basis of promises of technically advanced 'jam tomorrow'\".\n\nLast November, Mr Johnson announced a \"once-in-a-generation modernisation\" of the armed forces.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's review, the Committee urged government not to ignore the \"decaying\" AFV fleet.\n\nThe report stated the Army is four years away from being able to field a \"warfighting division\", which, even under the Ministry Of Defence's (MOD) own current plans, would still be \"hopelessly under-equipped\".\n\nIt said soldiers called on to fight a 'peer adversary' - namely Russia - in the next few years \"would, disgracefully, be forced to go into battle in a combination of obsolescent or even obsolete armoured vehicles, most of them at least 30 years old or more\".\n\nMPs added the MOD needs to urgently address its shortfalls in artillery, air defence and anti-drone capabilities, citing the Russian investment in modern missile and rocket artillery systems which defined their rapid victory in Ukraine in 2014.\n\n\"A mixture of bureaucratic procrastination, military indecision, financial mismanagement and general ineptitude has led to a severe and sustained erosion of our military capabilities,\" said Mr Ellwood.\n\n\"This will have a profound and potentially devastating impact on our ability to respond to threats from adversaries.\"\n\n\"In a conflict, the capable men and women working for the armed forces may find themselves outmatched, reliant on a fleet of outdated and outmoded fighting vehicles.\n\n\"The government should make no mistake, these failures may cost lives.\"\n\nCommenting on the report, Labour said \"Conservative defence cuts and indecision\" had weakened the Army.\n\n\"Our Army would currently be forced to go into battle with out-of-date armoured vehicles that could be heavily outgunned. Nothing characterises Boris Johnson's 'era of retreat' over the last decade more starkly than this,\" said shadow defence secretary John Healey.",

            "section": "Wales politics",
            "content": "Universal credit: Stephen Crabb MP says benefits squeezed too much\n\nThe squeeze on universal credit has gone too far, according to the former work and pensions secretary.\n\nStephen Crabb, who also served as secretary of state for Wales, said: \"We haven't funded it sufficiently for it to achieve all of its aims.\"\n\nA freeze on working-age benefits was imposed from April 2016 to April 2020.\n\nThe UK government said it will focus on supporting people back into work as the economy reopens through the Plan For Jobs scheme.\n\nThe Child Poverty Action Group (Cpag) said the benefits system needed to do more to stop people falling into crisis in the first place.\n\nUniversal credit (UC) is designed to incentivise working, so that every extra \u00a31 of earnings, 63p in UC is lost.\n\nAccording to the Department for Work and Pensions, the temporary \u00a320 uplift and the equivalent for working tax credits are \"helping millions of families whose income has been affected by the pandemic\".\n\nBut Mr Crabb, Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, said the system needed to top this up \"so long as we have low wages in our society\".\n\n\"The system is designed to do that and to help people improve their lot, increase their hours and to move out of that situation,\" he explained.\n\n\"I really passionately believe in UC and I want it to work, but the secret to its success is how well it's funded.\n\n\"Over the last five years, I've come to the conclusion that we've squeezed it too much.\"\n\nMr Crabb voted against the government earlier this year when he called for the \u00a320 uplift to be extended for 12 months because he felt \"very strongly\" the Treasury plan at the time to bring it to an end would \"cause hardship for families\".\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced it would be extended for six months in the budget.\n\nEllie Harwood, from Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"What we really need from a social security system is something that catches people before they fall into crisis.\n\n\"It should be there for people when they need it and that's normally when they experience a life event like losing a job, having a child or a relationship breakdown.\"\n\nLouise Hall, from Newport, found herself back on UC because she was unable to work during the pandemic and the cost of equipment to make her practice as a child therapist Covid-safe left her and her eight-year-old son in crisis.\n\n\"It got the point that to be able to fund [going back to work] and to be able to look after us I had to go and ask for help from a foodbank which is really difficult and not something you want to do,\" she said.\n\nPreviously when a relationship broke down, Ms Hall had to rely on the social security system but she had begun to get back on her feet thanks to a loan for further training from a charity, Purple Shoots.\n\nShe said having to rely fully once again on UC was \"soul-destroying\" and she feared she would never be able to stop treading water.\n\n\"It feels never-ending, it feels soul destroying at times,\" she said.\n\n\"With the money that comes through, it is amazing. If we hadn't had it in the pandemic then I couldn't have afforded to live and to pay rent and to feed us, but it's really hard to live off it long term.\n\n\"It gets to your mental wellbeing and it gets to your future planning and you don't dream any more. You just go from month to month wondering whether you're going to have enough that month or not.\"\n\nMs Hall is not alone. The percentage of the Welsh population claiming UC has almost doubled since the start of the pandemic.\n\nFigures show 150,527 people were in receipt of the benefit in February of last year - 4.8% of the population.\n\nBut there was a significant rise at the start of the pandemic and by last April, 219,683 people in Wales were claiming UC.\n\nThis has crept up to a high of almost 280,000 in January this year - nearly 9% of the Welsh population.\n\nKaren Davies, the founder of Purple Shoots, the charity that gave Ms Hall a loan for training, said almost all of the people they help are on UC.\n\nShe feels the system can perpetuate poverty because it tapers off too quickly when claimants begin to earn more money.\n\n\"It can be a very demeaning process and it's very destructive for self-esteem,\" she said.\n\n\"You get a basic amount of money which is supposed to cover your living costs and your rent, but there's no money for anything else.\n\n\"You're in this spiral which you can't get out of. The amount of money is not enough for you to build anything else to move forward, it's not even enough to do a training course.\"\n\nWhile UC helps people survive, it does not \"help them to move forward\", Ms Davies added.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"With the extension of the temporary \u00a320 universal credit uplift, and the equivalent amount for those on working tax credits, we are helping millions of families whose income has been affected by the pandemic.\n\n\"As the economy reopens, we will focus on supporting people back into work through our comprehensive Plan for Jobs.\"",

Among the most famous are the Benin Bronzes seized from modern-day Nigeria. Barnaby Phillips finds out about one family's dilemma.\n\nOne morning in April 2016, a woman walked into Barclays Bank on London's exclusive Park Lane, to retrieve a mysterious object that had been locked in the vaults for 63 years.\n\nAttendants ushered her downstairs. Three men waited upstairs, perched anxiously on an uncomfortable sofa, watching customers go about their business.\n\nTwenty minutes later the woman appeared, carrying something covered in an old dishcloth. She unwrapped it, and everyone gasped.\n\nA youthful face cast in bronze or brass stared out at them. He had a beaded collar around his neck and a gourd on his head.\n\nThe men, an art dealer called Lance Entwistle and two experts from the auctioneers Woolley and Wallis, recognised it as an early Benin Bronze head, perhaps depicting an oba, or king, from the 16th Century.\n\nIt was in near-immaculate condition, with the dark grey patina of old bronze, much like a contemporary piece from the Italian Renaissance. They suspected it was worth millions of pounds. The bank staff quickly led them into a panelled room, where they placed the head on a table.\n\nThe woman who went down into the vaults is a daughter of an art dealer called Ernest Ohly, who died in 2008.\n\nI have chosen to call her Frieda and not reveal her married name to protect her privacy.\n\nErnest's father, William Ohly, who was Jewish, fled Nazi Germany and was prominent in London's mid-century art scene.\n\nWilliam Ohly's exhibitions in the late 1940s attracted aesthetes and celebrities\n\nWilliam Ohly lived \"at the nexus of culture, society and artists\", says Entwistle.\n\nHis \"Primitive Art\" exhibitions attracted collectors, socialites, and artists such as Jacob Epstein, Lucian Freud, Henry Moore, Francis Bacon, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell.\n\nHe died in 1955. Ernest Ohly inherited his love of art, but was a more reserved character.\n\n\"A very, very difficult man to know. He didn't let anything out. You did not know what he was thinking,\" said Entwistle.\n\nErnest Ohly's death provoked a ripple of excitement at the lucrative top end of the ethnographic art world. He was rumoured to have an extensive collection. His statues from Polynesia and masks from West Africa were auctioned in 2011 and 2013. And that, dealers assumed, was that.\n\nBut his children knew otherwise. In old age, he had told them he had one more sculpture. It was in a Barclays safe box and not to be sold, he specified, unless there was another Holocaust.\n\nIn 2016 matters were taken out of the children's hands. Barclays on Park Lane was closing its safe boxes; it told customers to collect their belongings.\n\nI met Lance Entwistle in 2019, in his library lined with books on African sculpture. His website said his company has been \"leading tribal art dealers for over 40 years\".\n\n\"Tribal art\" is a term that Western museums now avoid, but is still common in the world of auctions and private sales.\n\nI was bowled over. It was beautiful, moving and its emergence from obscurity was so exciting\"\n\nEntwistle has rarely been to Africa, and never to Nigeria, but he's well connected. The British Museum, the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris and the Metropolitan in New York have all bought pieces from him.\n\nI asked him how he had felt when Frieda pulled the cloth away from the Benin Bronze head in the bank.\n\n\"I was bowled over,\" he said. \"It was beautiful, moving, and its emergence from obscurity was so exciting. I'm very used to being told about a Benin head, a Benin plaque, a Benin horse and rider. Generally I'm not excited because 99 times out of 100 they're fake, and often the remaining 1% has been stolen.\"\n\nProvenance is everything in Entwistle's world. This time, thanks to the Ernest Ohly connection, he was confident he was dealing with a bona fide piece.\n\nHe told Frieda the Benin Bronze head was significant and unusual, and convinced her to take it home in a taxi, to her terraced house in Tooting, south London.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were brought to Europe in the spring of 1897, the loot of British soldiers and sailors who conquered the West African kingdom of Benin, in modern day Nigeria's Edo state.\n\nAlthough they are called Benin Bronzes, they are actually thousands of brass and bronze castings and ivory carvings. When some were displayed in the British Museum that autumn, they caused a sensation.\n\nAfricans, the British believed at the time, did not possess skills to produce pieces of such sophistication or beauty. Nor were they supposed to have much history.\n\nBut the bronzes - some portrayed Portuguese visitors in medieval armour - were evidently hundreds of years old.\n\nThey were our documents, our archives, the 'photographs' of our kings. When they were taken our history was exhumed\"\n\nBenin had been denigrated in British newspapers as a place of savagery, a \"City of Blood\". Now those newspapers described the Bronzes as \"surprising\", \"remarkable\" and admitted they were \"baffled\".\n\nSome of these bronzes are still owned by descendants of those who pillaged Benin, while others have passed from owner to owner.\n\nVictor Ehikhamenor, an artist from Edo state, told me the bronzes were not made only for aesthetic enjoyment.\n\n\"They were our documents, our archives, the 'photographs' of our kings. When they were taken our history was exhumed.\"\n\nBut as their value in the West has increased, they've also become prestige investments, held by the wealthy and reclusive.\n\nLondon auction sales tell the story. In 1953, Sotheby's sold a Benin Bronze head for \u00a35,500. The price raised eyebrows; the previous record for a Benin head was \u00a3780.\n\nIn 1968 Christie's sold a Benin head for \u00a321,000. (It had been discovered months earlier by a policeman who was pottering around his neighbour's greenhouse and noticed something interesting amidst the plants).\n\nIn the 1970s, \"Tribal Art\" prices soared, and Benin Bronzes led the way. And so it went on, all the way to 2007 when Sotheby's in New York sold a Benin head for $4.7m (\u00a32.35m).\n\nEntwistle kept an eye on that 2007 sale. The buyer, whose identity was not publicly revealed, was one of his trusted clients.\n\nNine years later, presented by Frieda with the challenge of selling Ernest Ohly's head, Lance knew where to turn.\n\n\"It was the first client I offered it to, which is what you want, there was no need to shop around,\" he said.\n\nThere was only a minor haggle over price. The client, Entwistle insisted, was motivated by his love of African art.\n\n\"He will never sell, in my view.\" Whoever he is, wherever he is, he paid another world record fee.\n\nThe \"Ohly head\", as Entwistle calls it, was sold for \u00a310m - a figure not previously disclosed.\n\nIf you envisaged the woman who sold the world's most expensive Benin Bronze, you might not come up with Frieda.\n\nWe met in the Tate Modern gallery, overlooking the Thames. She had travelled from Tooting by underground. She is a grandmother, with grey close-cropped hair and glasses. She used to work in children's nurseries, but is retired.\n\n\"My family is riddled with secrets,\" she said. \"My father refused to speak about his Jewish ancestry.\"\n\nShe did her own research on relatives who were killed in Nazi concentration camps. Ernest Ohly was haunted, \"paranoid\", says Frieda, by the prospect of another catastrophe engulfing the Jews.\n\nSix million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust - and, according to the Jewish Claims Conference, the Nazis seized an estimated 650,000 artworks and religious items from Jews and other victims.\n\nThe artworks produced in Benin City still seek to chronicle events - like this one depicting the slave trade\n\nErnest Ohly distrusted strangers and lived in a world of cash and secret objects. He kept a suitcase of \u00a350 notes under the bed.\n\n\"Ernie the Dealer\" was the family nickname. The children grew up surrounded by art. But by the end he was tired of life.\n\nHis house was chaotic, his Persian rugs infested with moths. The family found the suitcase of banknotes but discovered they were no longer legal tender.\n\nErnest Ohly may have let things slide, but he had been a formidable collector.\n\n\"He and my grandfather never went to Africa or the South Pacific, but got their knowledge from being around objects,\" said Freida.\n\n\"There was a whole group of European dealers in London, in the 1940s through to the 1970s.\"\n\nThe British Empire was ending, and the deaths of its last administrators and soldiers brought rich pickings.\n\n\"I never understood why my father was so interested in reading obituary pages. The Telegraph, the Times, really studying them. If they were Foreign Office, armed forces, anything to do with Empire, he wrote to the widows.\"\n\nErnest Ohly listed his buys in ledger books. That's how Entwistle found what he was looking for: \"Benin Bronze head... Dec 51, \u00a3230\" from Glendining's - a London auctioneers where he also bought coins and stamps.\n\nErnest Ohly's ledger showed how much he paid for the Benin Bronze in 1951\n\nIn today's money, that is just over \u00a37,000. In other words, a substantial purchase. But Ernest Ohly knew what he was doing. He had a steal. He put the head in the safe box in 1953, and it stayed there until 2016.\n\n\"It was like a lump of gold,\" said Frieda. The windfall was not quite as large as it might have been.\n\nErnest Ohly's affairs were a mess, and the taxman took a substantial amount. Still, Frieda says, she can sleep easy now. The Benin head bought care for her family, and property for her children.\n\nFrieda is married to a man of Caribbean descent - and her son is a journalist.\n\nA few years ago he wrote an article about how the Edo - the people of the Benin Kingdom - tried to stop the sale at Sotheby's of a Benin ivory mask.\n\nIn fact, although he did not know this, it was a mask that his great-grandfather, William Ohly, displayed at his gallery in 1947.\n\nThe article described Edo outrage that the family who owned the mask - relatives of a British official who looted it in 1897 - should profit from what they regarded as theft and a war crime.\n\nFrieda is too intelligent and sensitive not to appreciate the layers of irony behind her story. She had followed the arguments about whether the Benin Bronzes should be returned to Nigeria.\n\nBritain has laws to enable the return of art looted by the Nazis, but there is no similar legislation to cover its own colonial period.\n\n\"Part of me will always feel guilty for not giving it to the Nigerians\u2026 It's a murky past, tied up with colonialism and exploitation.\"\n\n\"But that's in the past, lots of governments aren't stable and things have been destroyed. I'm afraid I took the decision to sell. I stand by it. I wanted my family to be secure.\"\n\nFrieda is not the only owner of Benin Bronzes who has wrestled with their conscience in recent years.\n\nMark Walker, a doctor from Wales, returned two Bronzes which had been taken by his grandfather, an officer on the 1897 expedition.\n\nHe received a hero's welcome in Benin City.\n\nOthers are hesitant. In an imposing west London mansion block I met an elderly woman whose grandfather also looted Bronzes in 1897.\n\nTen, or even five years ago, it would not have been difficult to get somebody in her position to talk. But today the owners of Benin Bronzes are cautious, and I agreed to hide this woman's identity.\n\nShe showed me two brass oro \"prophecy birds\". I asked if they made her feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"I've felt misgivings, considerations that crossed my mind\u2026 Maybe misgivings is too strong a word. I don't feel like giving them anything.\" There was a long silence.\n\n\"You know,\" she said, \"one bumbles along for 77 years, and suddenly this has become a sensitive subject. It never was before.\"\n\nFrieda and I left the Tate and were walking along the Thames.\n\nI was about to say goodbye. Unprompted, she returned to the Benin Bronzes.\n\nSometimes, she said, she wished her father had sold that head when he was still alive.\n\nA dilemma would have been taken out of her hands.\n\n\"It was difficult for me,\" she said again. \"Part of me felt we should have given it back.\" Then she was gone.\n\nBarnaby Phillips is a former BBC Nigeria correspondent.

He was remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March.\n\nMs Everard disappeared when walking home to Brixton from Clapham in south London on 3 March.\n\nHer body was found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, Westminster Magistrates Court heard.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Sarah Everard: What went wrong at the Clapham vigil?\n\nMaintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe.\n\nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in.\n\nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head.\n\nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control.\n\nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing.\n\nEarlier in the week it became increasingly clear that people up and down the UK wanted to hold vigils for Sarah Everard.\n\nWomen in London, organising under the Reclaim These Streets banner, approached Met commanders for their help in setting up a vigil on Clapham Common in south London, close to where Ms Everard was last seen alive.\n\nThe police said a demo would be illegal under the coronavirus lockdown regulations.\n\nAnd so the women and their lawyers asked the High Court to make a declaration that would force the police to think again.\n\nThe problem is that the law is not that clear cut.\n\nFor almost a year, the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and the public grasping for answers as to what is possible in public. It's so complex we've even seen people fined for walking while holding a cup of tea.\n\nGatherings in public are generally banned in England but, at the same time, the rules recognise there are \"reasonable excuses\" to be outside.\n\nBut the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses.\n\nNo matter what the Covid regulations say, there is an overarching right to freedom of expression that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. That means the police have a legal duty to help make safe protests possible.\n\nBut that right is not an absolute trump card - it can be interfered with if the police can show they have good reason to stop an event happening.\n\nAnd after hours of difficult legal argument on Friday, the judge refused to intervene and basically told the two sides to work it out for themselves with all those legal principles in mind.\n\nIn the absence of further legal clarity, the organisers claimed victory. They said the police had to now negotiate a sensible well-run vigil.\n\nThen, the police pushed back hard. They said they too had been vindicated. They could not authorise a potentially unlimited demonstration that would become an enormous Covid-spreading event. Stay at home, they said.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the organisers abandoned their plans amid a very serious risk they could each face a \u00a310,000 fine for organising a lockdown-breaking gathering.\n\nBut by that point, it was inevitable that people would turn up at Clapham Common, whether or not there was going to be a public event. It was the talk of social media.\n\nSo given that racing certainty, and the lack of official marshals that Reclaim These Streets said they would have provided had the police agreed to a vigil, what was the police's plan to keep people safe?\n\nThe turning point in Scotland Yard's tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, around 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: \"At this point, officers on the ground were faced with a very difficult decision.\n\n\"Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.\"\n\nAnd so, they tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people whom they believed were contributing to the crowding.\n\nPatsy Stevenson, the red-haired woman caught on camera being handcuffed on the ground at the bandstand, received a \u00a3200 Covid fine as police tried to remove her from the area.\n\nShe has not been accused of, or charged with, violence - but was there any elsewhere?\n\nThere was definitely a lot of anger - with some of the crowd chanting obscenities at the police at one point.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Federation, representing frontline officers, says 26 of them were assaulted yesterday at Clapham - punched, kicked and spat at.\n\nPictures obtained by the Press Association clearly show three instances of officers being forcibly pushed and a van's wing mirror being deliberately vandalised. Guess what? All three instances involved men, not women.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball has said the Met did not want to be in the position where it had to turn to enforcement. But what's not clear is why this demonstration was considered to be so much more of a Covid risk than others that commanders couldn't find a way to make it possible.\n\nPolice forces elsewhere in the UK were waiting for a lead from the Met. But those that saw DIY vigils - albeit far smaller ones - appeared to take a stand-back approach.\n\nThe better comparison is Black Lives Matter last summer, when there were large crowds in London and elsewhere that were clearly not socially distancing.\n\nWhy the difference? That, and other questions about how the operation unfolded, may have been answered in the report that's been sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel.\n\nShe's now asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out its own external review of the event - and what Ms Patel ultimately concludes may dictate whether Dame Cressida survives calls for her to go.\n\nWhile the commissioner is accountable to the Mayor of London, who has raised his own serious concerns after a meeting with Dame Cressida, the Home Secretary is jointly responsible for deciding who gets the job - and when they should go.\n\nDame Cressida is highly respected both in policing and government - far more so than some of her predecessors - but she remains a controversial figure for many others.\n\nShe commanded the 2005 operation that led to the shooting dead of Jean Charles De Menezes, after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber - although a jury exonerated her of any personal wrongdoing.\n\nMore recently, she called for better powers to deal with Extinction Rebellion's repeated occupations of parts of London. The government agreed - and the home secretary's proposals to greatly expand the police's ability to curtail demonstrations goes before Parliament on Monday.\n\nAsk most police officers who have experience of covering public protests, and they will tell you they often feel - individual mistakes besides - it is a no-win situation when things go wrong. (Just last week I was talking about this very dilemma on BBC Newscast.)\n\nIt would be something of a terrible twist of fate for the commissioner - the first woman in the post - to lose her job in these circumstances.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Pandemic impact 'yet to be felt' on High Streets\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has thrown Britain's High Streets into crisis, yet the full force of its impact has yet to be felt, according to accountants PwC.\n\nMore than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to new data.\n\nThat's an average rate of 48 closures a day.\n\nBut the figures, which include hospitality and leisure venues, but not independent retailers, suggest the trend began before the pandemic.\n\nThe research was conducted by the Local Data Company which tracks vacancy rates in nearly 3,500 High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks.\n\nIt recorded 17,532 closures in 2020. It also reported 7,665 store openings. This resulted in a net loss of 9,877 outlets, the worst annual decline researchers have seen in more than a decade.\n\nHowever, the full impact of the pandemic has yet to be felt, according to Lisa Hooker, head of consumer markets at PWC, so the picture is likely to get worse before it gets better.\n\nThese numbers, for instance, only include store closures which are known to be permanent. Many outlets which have closed \"temporarily\" may never re-open.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is still quite a lot to play out. You've seen the closures of the likes of Debenhams and Topshop and that's happening in 2021 so they're not even in our numbers,\" Ms Hooker says.\n\n\"Much of the impact is a reflection of things that happened before the pandemic. This was not just the move online but areas such as legislative changes, for example for betting shops, consolidation due to overexpansion, or chain-wide closures for restaurants and mobile phone stores that found themselves in trouble pre-Covid-19.\"\n\nAs a result closures were rising and openings were falling even before the pandemic hit.\n\nShopping centres saw the largest proportion of their stores closed, whilst retail parks fared the best.\n\nFashion retailers and betting shops were the worst performing categories. Meanwhile takeaway outlets, and cake shops, enjoyed some growth. And city centres are doing worse than suburbs and commuter towns, driven by the number of people working from home.\n\n\"Looking at where this this opening and closure activity has predominated really tells the story of changing consumer preferences and shifting demand, \" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company.\n\n\"On the whole, flagship, city centre high streets and shopping centres saw a greater decline in chain stores versus more local markets and retail parks which proved to be more convenient and perceptibly safer.\"\n\nThere is regional disparity, too. For the first time, London has been hit harder than other regions with a record increase in net closures this year. Together with the South East, they account for a third of the decline of all shops.\n\nRichmond, on the edge of south-west London, has suddenly found itself with a challenge on its hands. It's a prosperous, popular destination, but has lost about a dozen names over the last 12 months, including Moss Bross, Massimo Dutti, Cos and House of Fraser.\n\n\"Our High Street has undergone change and so has every High Street in Britain,\" says Gabriel Irwin, who owns a specialist shoe shop, Foot Solutions, just around the corner from the former House of Fraser store, the biggest vacant unit in town.\n\n\"It's a perfect storm, from internet shopping taking a greater market share to the perception amongst retailers, that we are a high-rent, high-rates district.\"\n\nBut Mr Irwin says Richmond will bounce back and that, anecdotally, landlords have already been talking to potential new tenants, who are encouraged by lower rents. The House of Fraser site is also being redeveloped.\n\nPWC's Lisa Hooker also believes that as we emerge from the pandemic there will be opportunities for the gaps to be filled.\n\n\"After the global financial crisis, we saw the growth of discounters and food service chains that replaced exiting retailers. There is an opportunity for operators who can find the right location at the right time, to thrive, even despite the current uncertainty.\"",

Bristol-based portrait photographer, Nina Raingold, met mothers who have experienced the challenges of giving birth during Covid restrictions in the UK.\n\nHere's what they shared in their own words.\n\n\"The hardest part about being pregnant in lockdown was that my husband Pete couldn't come to my appointments or scans, and it's quite scary to do that by yourself.\n\n\"We were always a bit worried that one of us would get sick; it put a fog of anxiety over the last trimester.\n\n\"Pete couldn't be with me for some of my labour. I had to go into the maternity triage and he wasn't allowed in.\n\n\"All the stuff you prepare for labour is with your birth partner; I hadn't planned to do 45 minutes of it in the waiting room on my own!\"\n\n\"We were in complete lockdown on the day I gave birth.\n\n\"It was so quiet getting to the hospital. Looking out of the window, there was nobody on the streets.\n\n\"I thought maybe I wanted to give birth at home because of the virus, but they said I had to have the baby in the labour ward.\n\n\"The virus was so new and they didn't know what was going to happen.\n\n\"They just had the high numbers of deaths from all the other countries. I remember it being a very surreal time.\n\n\"So many people were dying every day. To have that on your mind and then to go to hospital where you'll be in contact with so many different people was a scary thought.\"\n\n\"The worst thing in the whole pregnancy was that after an incredibly long labour, [my partner] Joe had to leave the hospital an hour after I had given birth.\n\n\"We did skin-to-skin contact with the baby with me, and then with him, and then he had to go.\n\n\"I had to stay with her for two days by myself. If he'd have been there, I think I would have been fine.\n\n\"I was dealing with it because all the other women were dealing with it, but it didn't feel good at all.\n\n\"Being pregnant during the pandemic wasn't actually that bad because we had some lovely 'us time', much more than we would have done before having a baby.\n\n\"If you're getting on with your partner, then actually you go into a lovely little cocoon.\n\n\"But it's sad for your partner not to be with the baby immediately.\"\n\nYou can hear more from the mums and see their gorgeous baby pictures here.",
