My wife Tonya and I, we're coming,\" the director added.\n\nBut with Covid-19 cases still at high levels in France, there is a chance that the event could be called off again.\n\n\"Throughout the months of uncertainty we've just been through, Spike Lee has never stopped encouraging us,\" festival president Pierre Lescure said in a statement.\n\n\"We could not have hoped for a more powerful personality to chart our troubled times.\"\n\nLee first made an impact on the film industry at Cannes in 1986 with She's Gotta Have It, which won the youth award. He returned to the festival three years later with Do The Right Thing, his landmark film about one day of charged race relations in Brooklyn.\n\nOther Lee films to have been screened at Cannes have included Summer of Sam and BlacKkKlansman, while he is also known for Malcolm X and his latest release, Da 5 Bloods, about a group of US Army veterans returning to Vietnam.\n\nThe official selection for this year's festival, along with the rest of the jury, are due to be named in early June.\n\nHong Kong auteur Wong Kar-wai is the only Asian to have been president of the Cannes jury, while French-Algerian actress Isabelle Adjani was the first of African descent to preside in 1997.\n\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "content": "Mars: Vast amount of water may be locked up on planet\n\nThe Curiosity rover has found extensive evidence of hydrated minerals at Mars' Gale Crater\n\nIt's a longstanding mystery: how Mars lost the water that flowed across its surface billions of years ago.\n\nScientists now think they have an answer: much of it became trapped in the planet's outer layer - its crust.\n\nThe ancient water exists in the form of minerals contained within Martian rocks.\n\nThe findings have been discussed at the 52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference and are published in Science journal.\n\nThe study used measurements gathered from Mars-orbiting spacecraft, rovers and meteorites.\n\nResearchers then developed a computer simulation of how water was lost from the planet over time.\n\nMore than four billion years ago, Mars was warmer and wetter - possibly with a thicker atmosphere. Water coursed through rivers, cutting channels in the rock, and pooled in impact craters.\n\nThe Red Planet could have held enough water to cover its entire surface in a layer measuring between 100m and one kilometre deep.\n\nAround a billion years later, Mars had made the transition to the colder, desolate planet we recognise today.\n\n\"We have known for a long time that Mars was much wetter in its early history. But, the exact fate of that water has been an ongoing problem,\" said planetary scientist Dr Peter Grindrod, who was not involved with the latest study.\n\nDr Grindrod, from London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News: \"We already know from studies of the atmosphere of Mars that some of that water was lost to space, and ice deposits on and just below the surface tell us that some water became frozen.\"\n\nEarth has a magnetic shield, or magnetosphere, that helps prevent the atmosphere from escaping. But Mars' magnetic shield is weak and could have allowed elemental components of water to escape from the planet.\n\nBut the rate at which hydrogen - one chemical constituent of water - escapes from that atmosphere today suggests this can't be the whole story.\n\nIf it's assumed that the current loss rate for hydrogen was the same in the past, \"it's a pretty small amount of water that you would have lost through this escape process\", said co-author Eva Linghan Scheller, from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena.\n\nIn other words, most of the water must have gone elsewhere.\n\nNasa's latest rover will explore a geological feature called a delta, laid down in the presence of flowing water\n\nThe results of the team's computer modelling work show that between 30% and 99% of Mars' initial water was incorporated into minerals and buried in the planet's crust.\n\nCo-author Prof Bethany Ehlmann, also from from Caltech, explained that, \"by studying data from Mars missions, It became clear that it was common - and not rare - to find evidence of water alteration\".\n\nShe continued: \"When the crust becomes altered, it takes water - like liquid water - and sequesters it in a hydrated mineral that has water in its structure so that it is effectively trapped.\"\n\nThe authors suggest that most of the water was lost between about 4.1 and 3.7 billion years ago - during a stretch of Martian history known as the Noachian Period.\n\nDr Michael Meyer, lead scientist for Nasa's Mars exploration program, said: \"The original overarching role of Mars exploration has been to follow the water, since it plays such a central role in the geology, climate and life of the planet.\n\n\"This is a very important paper to understand how much water was on Mars, how it might have been lost and where it might be today.\"\n\nDr Grindrod added: \"What this new study tells us is that a lot of that water, possibly the majority, could have actually been locked into the rocks on Mars. This process of hydration is capable of storing large volumes of water, up to an amount equivalent to a global layer a kilometre deep.\"\n\n\"Although most of the liquid water had probably disappeared after about one and a half billion years after Mars formed, we see evidence of hydrated minerals at the surface today, in areas like Jezero Crater, which is currently being explored by the Perseverance rover.\n\n\"The early climate of Mars remains one of the most important topics in planetary science, and this study will help our understanding of the processes responsible for water loss.\"",

Protect yourself and others,\" he said.\n\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster also urged those eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine.\n\n\"The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) have been very clear that it is safe to take the AstraZeneca vaccine,\" said the DUP leader.\n\n\"I am looking forward to taking it, either this week or next week, depending on when I am able to get my vaccine booked for, but it is very important that people continue to take the vaccine.\"\n\nOn Monday, Dr Alan Stout, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) NI GP committee, said it was the large supply of AstraZeneca jab that allowed the vaccination programme to continue at the speed it is.\n\nHe advised people that it was safe to receive, and there was also a risk of blood clotting with things like long-haul air travel, the contraception pill, and some forms of surgery.\n\n\"These are world experts that we have in these regulators bodies and they are all saying the same thing, and they are all saying it is safe,\" he said.\n\nDr Stout said he was \"hopeful\" jabs would be offered to the over-40s age group by Easter, mirroring the situation reportedly happening elsewhere in the UK.\n\nWhile health officials in the Republic of Ireland are choosing to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, in Northern Ireland they're accelerating the programme. So who should we trust?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the vaccine is safe. That message has been reinforced by the British Medical Association.\n\nIt's hard to ignore that the MHRA has said that it has received a small number of reports of blood clots relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nBut it does seem that health officials in the Republic are being excessively cautious - Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and the country's deputy chief medical officer have said as much themselves.\n\nRelations between the EU and AstraZeneca are somewhat toxic at present with the Republic of Ireland, where the vaccine is reportedly in short supply, having been let down so many times on delivery of the vaccine.\n\nWhile people in the Republic will be rolling down their sleeves, in Northern Ireland an even greater number are preparing to roll them up.\n\nThe rollout will continue to be prioritised based on age, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, the Department of Health has said.\n\nVaccines are being dispensed in parallel by GP practices and vaccination centres.\n\nNorthern Ireland has seven regional vaccination centres: Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, South Lake Leisure Centre, Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Foyle Arena, Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre.\n\nPlans are also being finalised for community pharmacies to join the programme in the coming weeks, the department added.\n\nAn additional regional mass vaccination centre will open at the end of March at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\n\nThe vaccination centres are now offering bookings to:\n\nCarers who have not already booked a vaccination appointment can email their health trust carer co-ordinators and they will make the necessary arrangements.\n\nThe latter clinically vulnerable (CV) group is expected to largely mirror those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.\n\nCEV and CV individuals aged 16 and 17 years of age cannot receive the vaccine being used in GP practices.\n\nThese individuals will receive a letter from their GP and are able to book a vaccination slot at one of the vaccination centres.\n\nPeople who want to book a vaccination centre appointment are asked to do so online if it all possible.\n\nIf online booking is not possible, then the telephone booking number is 0300 200 7813.\n\nThe booking line is open 08:00 GMT until 20:00 Monday to Friday.",

Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.\n\nColman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father.\n\nCarey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director.\n\nKirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively.\n\nOther British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\n\nSix black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017.

She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor.\n\nMinari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.\n\nBoseman is nominated alongside Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - his final role before he died of cancer at the age of 43 last year.\n\nThe much-loved star, who is also known for his role in Black Panther, is the favourite to be given the best actor award.\n\nIf he does, he will be only the second posthumous best actor winner after Peter Finch for Network in 1976.\n\nOnly five women had been nominated for best director before, and only one has won - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010.\n\nThis year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van.\n\nZhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director.

View original tweet on Twitter\n\nFennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year.\n\nOverall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards.\n\nThe 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n\"I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,\" she said.\n\nHer previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year?\n\nProbably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel.\n\nPlus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.\n\nMank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture.\n\nCrucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script.\n\nIt has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited.\n\nMank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves.\n\nIt would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley.\n\nI have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination.",

People are either more self-consciously aware or a loved one has noticed,\" he said.\n\nIn 2020, 114 people from Wales contacted the helpline about their own or someone else's behaviour, with 2,750 viewing the self-help website.\n\nMr Findlater added: \"Due to the pandemic, feelings of isolation, stress and general uncertainty, over the last year in particular, are often what leads to our callers' escalating pornography habits, and in turn, illegal online behaviour.\n\n\"It can be really tricky to spot the signs but they can include, becoming much more secretive with online devices, using them at odd times - such as early in the morning and feeling guilty or uneasy the next day.\"\n\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: \"Anyone who is having inappropriate thoughts about children, or anyone who believes a family member may be, should seek help from Stop It Now!, otherwise they should expect a visit from police officers.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

One of the best actors in Hollywood, a Legend. Rest in Peace Honey, I'm gonna miss you everyday, my best friend, my rock.\"\n\nI'm saddened and still in shocked of the passing of my husband Yaphet of 24 years. He died last night around 10:30pm... Posted by Sinahon Thessa on Monday, March 15, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original post on Facebook\n\nTributes came from Hollywood figures including Ava DuVernay, who said he was \"one of those actors who deserved more than the parts he got\", and fellow director Edgar Wright, who described him as \"a brilliant magnetic presence\".\n\nKotto was born in New York to a Cameroonian immigrant father and a US Army nurse, and studied acting from the age of 16. At 19, he made his professional theatre debut in Othello, and later performed on Broadway in The Great White Hope.\n\nHis first few film projects included Nothing But a Man in 1964 and The Thomas Crown Affair in 1968.\n\nKotto drew plaudits for his role as the first black Bond villain Dr Kananga - an evil Caribbean diplomat whose alter ego was a New York drug lord - in Live and Let Die, starring Roger Moore.\n\nKotto then had roles in 1974's Truck Turner and 1978's Blue Collar. In Ridley Scott's Alien, he took the role of the space ship's engineer Dennis Parker.\n\nYaphet Kotto had a varied career in film and TV\n\nFollowing the film's success, Kotto turned down a role in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back because he was wary of becoming typecast in the sci-fi genre.\n\n\"I wanted to get back down on Earth,\" he said in an interview. \"I was afraid that if I did another space film after having done Alien, then I'd be typed.\n\n\"Once you get one of those big blockbuster hits, you better have some other big blockbuster hits to go with it too and be Harrison Ford, because if you don't\u2026 you place yourself right out of the business.\"\n\nHe also said he turned down the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the character made famous by Sir Patrick Stewart in Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\n\"I should have done that, but I walked away,\" he admitted in 2015. \"When you're making movies, you'd tend to say no to TV. It's like when you're in college and someone asks you to the high school dance. You say no.\"\n\nKotto went on to play a supporting role in Brubaker in 1980, and then appear as a resistance fighter alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987's The Running Man, and as an FBI agent in Robert De Niro's Midnight Run the following year.\n\nHis other film credits also included Bill Cosby's Man and Boy (1971), Across 110th Street (1972), Report to the Commissioner (1975), The Star Chamber (1983), Warning Sign (1985), Eye of the Tiger (1986) and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991).\n\nKotto's other TV roles included appearances in For Love and Honor, Murder She Wrote and Death Valley Days.\n\nMost recently, he reprised his role as Lieutenant Giardello in Homicide: The Movie in 2000, and voiced his Alien character Parker in the Alien: Isolation video game.\n\nKotto is survived by six children and had been married three times.\n\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "content": "Chocolate maker Thorntons has said none of its stores will reopen after coronavirus lockdowns are lifted.\n\nThe decision to close its 61 shops will put more than 600 jobs at risk.\n\nThe company said it had been badly hit by the pandemic, which forced its stores to shut their doors during the crucial Christmas and Easter holidays.\n\n\"The obstacles we have faced and will continue to face on the High Street are too severe,\" said Thorntons retail director Adam Goddard.\n\n\"Despite our best efforts we have taken the difficult decision to permanently close our retail store estate.\"\n\nThorntons has been on the High Street for more than a century but these days history isn't enough to guarantee survival.\n\nIt was losing its way in the early 2000s with newer players, like Hotel Chocolat, entering the scene. It also embarked on a strategy of selling more chocolates through supermarkets and closing unprofitable shops.\n\nItalian food giant Ferrero bought the business in 2015 and has been trying to turn it around ever since. Over the last five years, it's shrunk from 252 to 61 stores.\n\nBut Ferrero has now thrown in the towel on Thorntons stores altogether, betting that the brand's future is now online and on the supermarket shelves.\n\nThis pandemic has created brutal trading conditions for so many traditional retailers. And the high street shakeout is still far from over.\n\nThorntons said it had spent \u00a345m transforming the business with changes to the way stores operate and the introduction of new cafes but its plans had been thrown off course by the pandemic.\n\nThe company, which was founded in Sheffield in 1911, said it would continue to sell its chocolate online and try to sell more through supermarkets.\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis, sales through its website have increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, it said.\n\nIt will also try to expand the range of products made at its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire and increase international sales.\n\nIn 2011, Thorntons announced plans to massively reduce the number of stores it had on the High Street and in shopping centres.\n\nIt said it would close up to 180 of the 364 stores it had at the time, following a strategic review.\n\nSince then, the number of stores has dwindled to 61.\n\nIn 2015, Italian food giant Ferrero bought the chocolate chain for \u00a3112m.\n\nIn a statement, the company said: \"We remain committed to this iconic British brand and will continue to invest further in the future potential of Thorntons to ensure we evolve with the times.\"\n\nThorntons is just the latest well-known name to suffer the impact that rolling lockdowns have had on the High Street as more people take to shopping online.\n\nMore than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to figures from the Local Data Company. That is an average rate of 48 closures a day.\n\nLast week, department store chain John Lewis announced plans to close more stores. Other casualties have included PSir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, which included Topshop and Dorothy Perkins.\n\nAre you a Thorntons employee?

I came in on the Christmas weekend, our biggest weekend, they had taken every single item.\n\n\"I had to run around to all my friends and borrow dryers, scissors, just to be able to work that day.\n\n\"I was really very, very upset, but also angry. How dare they? I worked really hard all my life to have this, just for someone to come in and take it.\"\n\nMs Titmus said it had happened so many times she no longer made claims on her insurance because of the increase it would mean to her premium.\n\n\"Other times they've cost me \u00a3500 when they break a window and they probably had about 30p in pennies that were left in the drawer,\" she said.\n\n\"We just have to write it off as a loss. We work hard for a week to pay the burglar - that's how it works out.\"\n\nMore than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the number of theft and burglary offences in England and Wales fell as many people stayed at home.\n\nMinister for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said, with levels expect to return to those seen before Covid-19, the tagging pilot was \"critical\".\n\n\"We want to make sure we help those offenders get back on the straight and narrow,\" he said.\n\n\"We think 24-hour-a-day supervision, through this tag on their ankle, will help them to realise that they're effectively being watched, and therefore choose something else to do, other than go back to their former crime.\n\n\"It's a rigorous supervision in a way that we haven't really seen before and we think it will have a big impact.\"\n\nMore than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released from prison, according to MoJ figures.\n\nIt said these types of crimes cost the public an estimated \u00a34.8bn a year, yet 79% of theft cases and 62% of robbery cases resulted in no suspect being identified - compared with an average of 24% in all other cases.\n\nFollowing the pilots, the MoJ said it planned to roll out the scheme, run by the National Probation Service, to a further 13 forces in September.\n\nTags have already been introduced in parts of England and Wales to monitor whether offenders who who were convicted of committing crimes while fuelled with alcohol, have been drinking.\n\nThe \"sobriety tags\" monitor sweat levels of the wearer every 30 minutes to see whether they have drunk alcohol. The probation service is then alerted if they have had a drink.\n\nGwent's Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said a small number of offenders were committing thefts, burglaries and robberies.\n\n\"Offenders tend to be serial offenders doing quite a lot of these types of crime over a short period of time, that can be very forensically aware, they can locate premises that aren't overlooked so there aren't any witnesses and then it becomes very difficult to pull those clues together to solve that particular crime.\n\n\"Obviously with the ability to be able to tag our persistent offenders it means we're able to see where they are and if they're in proximity of offences that have occurred,\" she said.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

The company plans to launch a new version of it in 2023.\n\nFord Otosan, a joint venture between the American giant and Turkish company Ko\u00e7 Holding, will manufacture the new van at its plant in Kocaeli, in Northwestern Turkey.\n\nDagenham will build diesel engines for the new model - which will also be available as an electric van, as well as in various hybrid forms.\n\nAlthough moves to electrify passenger cars are proceeding rapidly, Ford says it expects diesel to continue to play an important role in commercial vehicles for many years.\n\nDemand from Ford Otosan, which will also build a similar-sized van on behalf of Volkswagen, is expected to account for up to 60% of Dagenham's diesel engine production by 2025.\n\nFord said the trade agreement reached between Turkey and the UK in late 2020 was \"extremely significant\" for its business - pointing out that Ford and Ford Otosan together account for more than 10% of the trade volume between the two countries.\n\nFord closed its Bridgend plant last year, as part of a drastic overhaul of its European business.\n\nThe factory, which opened in 1977, was unable to obtain enough new work after two major engine programmes ended in 2019.\n\nFive other factories in Europe were also shut, and some 10,000 workers were laid off.\n\nTransit vans were once built at a plant near Southampton, but in 2013 the factory was closed and production was moved to Turkey, where Ford said production costs were much lower.\n\nThe International Trade Minister, Ranil Jayawardena, described Ford's announcement as \"great news for Ford and its 7,500 workers across the United Kingdom\".",

But we can't afford to simply throw caution to the wind.\n\n\"The virus is still out there. We've seen that in the past week with a slight increase in cases, and of course the virus is more infectious now than when we came out of lockdown last year,\n\n\"So taking care, being cautious, being sensible really matters if we are to avoid letting the virus run ahead of the vaccine.\"\n\nOpposition parties will have the chance to question Ms Sturgeon following her statement, and have been pushing for more detail about her plans.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\n\nHe said: \"We expect a roadmap that tells everyone to get ready - because we're getting our normal lives back.\n\n\"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone, but they deserve more clarity.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, meanwhile, has said the government must focus on improving the test and trace system as well as the vaccine programme if the virus is to be contained at low levels.\n\nAnd he has called for better recovery plans for the post-pandemic period, saying: \"Even when lockdown ends, and the virus is almost eliminated, we will still have to pick up the pieces and rebuild the country we love.\n\n\"Because the last year has torn through the very fabric of our society. The effects of the pandemic have hit us all, but it has also exposed the deep inequalities in our communities.\"",

            "content": "Scotland's chief medical officer has said he is \"wholly confident\" in the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nA number of European countries have suspended use of the vaccine amid fears that it may cause blood clots.\n\nHowever, watchdogs including the World Health Organisation have found no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\n\nDr Gregor Smith said he would \"categorically state that we remain confident\" in the vaccine programme.\n\nAnd First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to continue to come forward for appointments when invited, saying they provide \"significant protection\" against the virus.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland has joined countries including the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway in pausing their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - people developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered.\n\nHowever, with almost five million people having been given a first dose of the vaccine across Europe, AstraZeneca said this number of clots was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\n\nBoth the WHO and the European Medicines Agency have said there is no indication that the jab was causing the blood clots.\n\nDr Gregor Smith said studies had found \"no causal link\" between the vaccine and blood clots\n\nThe use of vaccines in the UK is governed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which has backed the continued use of the AstraZeneca jab.\n\nAt the Scottish government's daily Covid-19 briefing, Dr Smith said there had been \"no causal link between any of these incidents and the AstraZeneca vaccine\".\n\nHe said: \"What we can say at this point in time is that looking at the data about blood clots both in Europe and the UK, it is no more common to have an episode of a blood clot than you would see in the general population - in fact it is somewhat less.\n\n\"Between one and two people in a thousand would suffer a blood clot in any given year. Among the 17 million or so vaccinations given with the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, we have not seen any signal coming through whatsoever to suggest there are any more blood clots than expected in that population.\n\n\"People in that population are going to continue to become ill anyway - they will have events that they would have had whether they had had the vaccine or not.\n\n\"What we are looking for in this data, what the MHRA will be looking for, is any signs of those events being over or above what is expected - and they are not seeing that.\"\n\nNicola Sturgeon said the pace of the vaccine programme should \"pick up significantly\" in the coming days\n\nMs Sturgeon said she would be happy to be given the AstraZeneca jab, and urged others to continue to come forward.\n\nThe first minister said she was in the age group that should be given a first dose of the vaccine by mid-April, saying she was \"hoping to see my blue envelope appear at some point in the next couple of weeks\".\n\nShe added: \"As soon as I get that, I will be there without hesitation, regardless of which of the vaccines I am being offered. And I would urge everybody getting an invitation to be vaccinated to be vaccinated, because it provides you and people you live with significant protection.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said \"virtually all\" Scots over the age of 65 had now had a first dose of vaccine, as had 53% of 60-64 year olds, 41% of 55-59 year olds and 33% of those aged 50 to 54.\n\nShe said the pace of vaccination should \"pick up significantly\" in the coming days, with supplies expected to be available for 400,000 doses to be administered over the course of the week.\n\nThis is projected to continue into next month, with the government \"on track\" to hit its target of completing all priority groups - including over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with underlying health conditions - by mid-April.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"That will be a really significant milestone, if and when we meet that target. It provides all of us with firmer grounds for hope for the months and weeks ahead.\"\n\nThe first minister will set out plans for further easing of lockdown restrictions at Holyrood on Tuesday, with moves to re-open shops and hospitality venues and lift the \"stay at home\" order expected to be scheduled through April and into May.\n\nIn his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference, leader Douglas Ross challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\n\nHe said: \"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone - but they deserve more clarity.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for a \"balanced\" approach, saying: \"We have to make sure this is the last lockdown.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let's not just think the silver bullet is the vaccine - it is one part of trying to drive down the virus, but if we are going to truly have an elimination strategy we have got to suppress the virus to next to zero levels and isolate it at those small levels.\n\n\"In order to do that we've got to up the level of testing, and then alongside that we need to isolate the virus using our tracing system in a more effective way.\"",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe, the health secretary has said, after some European nations paused its use amid concern over blood clots.\n\nMatt Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\n\nSome 13 countries have suspended use of the vaccine while they seek further clarification on its safety.\n\nBut the UK's medicines watchdog, the MHRA, has said that evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots.\n\nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of blood clots in vaccinated people on Thursday.\n\nHowever, it said previously that it was still \"firmly convinced\" the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the risks and there was \"no indication\" the jab causes blood clots.\n\nAbout 17 million people across the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, the manufacturer AstraZeneca said.\n\nIt said the number of cases of blood clots reported was lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population.\n\nIn a bid to reassure the British public, Mr Hancock stressed that the MHRA, the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency all believed the vaccine was safe.\n\n\"We keep the effects of these vaccines under review all the time and we know that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is saving lives in the UK right now so if you get the call, get the jab,\" he said.\n\nAsked if there had been evidence of people declining the jab after the European suspensions, the health secretary said there were still \"huge numbers of people vaccinated every day\" and that \"enthusiasm for getting the vaccine is incredibly strong\".\n\nDowning Street has also defended the safety of the vaccine, with the PM's official spokesman insisting that Boris Johnson would be happy to take it when it came to his turn.\n\nMeanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall revealed on Tuesday that she had received the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to a pop-up vaccination centre in London with the Prince of Wales, Camilla joked that it \"didn't matter\" which jab she was given because \"I hate injections so much\".\n\nIt was announced in mid-February that Prince Charles, 72, and the duchess, 73, had received their first Covid jabs. Their ages meant they were included in the fourth priority group for the rollout of the vaccine.\n\nThe latest government figures show that 24,839,906 first doses of a Covid vaccine have now been given in the UK, with some 1,663,646 people receiving a second dose.\n\nCountries across Europe are seeking further clarity on the jab's safety, amid criticism of their decision to suspend its use.\n\nDenmark was first to pause its use of the vaccine, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\n\nGermany, France and Italy have said they are awaiting the outcome of the EMA investigation.\n\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the jab, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer it.\n\nDr Phil Bryan, vaccines safety lead at the MHRA, said that people \"should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so\".\n\n\"We are closely reviewing reports but given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.\"\n\nThe WHO, which is also investigating the reports, says there is no evidence that the clots were linked to the vaccine and it has urged countries not to pause their vaccination programmes.\n\nProf Jeremy Brown, a member of the UK government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said concerns about blood clots were \"overblown\" as they were unlikely to be linked to the jab.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme pausing its use would cause more illness and deaths than would be prevented \"by the unlikely situation that there's an increased risk of a very rare event occurring as a consequence of the vaccine\".\n\nSir Kent Woods, former chief executive of the MHRA and former chair of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast there would have been a \"denting of public confidence because of the disorderly situation in Europe\" and by suspending the use of the jab countries were \"increasing the risk to the population\".\n\nDr Jess Harvey, a GP in Shropshire, said she had received several calls from patients concerned about the possibility of blood clots linked to the vaccine.\n\nShe said she had not had any appointments cancelled yet but was worried about no-shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Public Health England said on Tuesday that it was investigating a new coronavirus variant previously reported by the Philippines, after two cases were identified in England.\n\nIt said one case was linked with international travel, while the other was still under investigation.\n\nPHE also said that two cases of the P.1 variant of concern first found in Brazil had been identified in England - with one in the West Midlands and another in Haringey, London.\n\nThis variant has a mutation - known as E484 - that means it can escape some of the immune response, which may mean vaccines work less effectively against it.\n\nBoth cases were linked with international travel to Brazil, PHE said, and bring the total number of UK cases of the variant to 12.",

            "section": "Scotland",
            "content": "From 26 April, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was expected all parts of Scotland currently in level 4 would move down to a \"modified\" level 3. The island communities currently in level 3 will have the option to move at that stage to level 2 but this could have implications for travel and will be discussed further. The new \"modified\" level 3 from 26 April would see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a caf\u00e9 or restaurant. Up to six people from up to three households can socialise outdoors. All remaining retail premises and close contact services will re-open. Gyms can open for individual exercise. Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open. Funerals and weddings including post-funeral events and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (no alcohol). From 17 May, it is hoped that all level 3 areas - or as many as possible - will move to level 2. This will see hospitality venues open until 22:30 indoors (alcohol permitted, two-hour dwell time) and 22:00 outdoors (alcohol permitted). Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a private home or public space. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls can reopen. Outdoor adult contact sport and indoor group exercise can restart. From early June, the ambition is for all of Scotland will move to level 1 - which will allow for a further easing of restrictions. Up to six people from up to three households will be able to socialise indoors in a home or public place. Up to eight people from three households can socialise outdoors. Eight 12-17 year olds can meet socially from eight households outdoors. Hospitality can remain open until 23:00. Indoor non-contact sport can take place. By the end of June, it is hoped that all of Scotland will move to at least level 0. This could mean a phased return of some office staff. The Scottish government will be assessing the situation on an ongoing basis, with a view to restoring as much normality as possible.",

We now need binding guarantees that a situation like this can never happen again.\n\n\"We need an asylum system that puts the welfare of those seeking asylum first, and for communities to be at the heart of decision making.\"\n\nMr Llywelyn added: \"The Home Office's use of the camp, especially during a global pandemic, has put immense strain on local people, services and the residents themselves.\n\nNaomi Phillips, director of policy and advocacy at the British Red Cross, said military barracks were \"completely inappropriate and inhumane as housing for people fleeing war, persecution and violence\".\n\nThe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants called the closure \"amazing news\" and said the Home Office now \"must shut Napier barracks too\".\n\n\"No-one should have been placed in these inhumane Covid traps in the first place,\" it added.\n\nThe Home Office said Penally \"provided emergency capacity in response to pressures put on the asylum estate during Covid\".\n\nIt added: \"As those pressures have eased we have decided not to extend emergency planning permission beyond six months. Napier will remain in operation in accordance with current needs.\n\n\"The home secretary will soon bring forward her plan to fix our broken asylum system and that plan will address the government's asylum estate.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

Their views have been widely reported as dismissive of them.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Holyrood inquiry committee published a further submission from a former government staffer, Lorraine Kay, supporting Mr Salmond's claims.\n\nThe former first minister has said he was passed the name of one of the complainers during the investigation, while meetings between himself and Ms Sturgeon were being arranged.\n\nMs Sturgeon has said she does not accept that this happened, but Ms Kay told MSPs that she was also told the name by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein.\n\nTwo other allies of the former first minster - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have also backed this account, which opposition MSPs say would be an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\".\n\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she believed Mr Salmond was already aware of who the complainers were, and that what was said to Mr Aberdein was \"a matter of contention\".",

            "content": "The British army is already the smallest it's been in 400 years. And it's about to get even smaller.\n\nA cut in the number of troops is expected in a defence review, due to be published next month.\n\nOptions include losing up to 10,000 soldiers from the regular Army's notional strength of 82,000 in order to help fund its modernisation.\n\nMinisters have made clear there will still have to be painful decisions for the armed forces, despite the extra \u00a316.5bn given to the Ministry of Defence over the next four years.\n\nA senior Army officer has told the BBC that technology will allow the Army to become \"leaner and more agile\".\n\nBut it comes amid warnings that the Army is already too small, and that more cuts will worry allies and limit its ability to fight.\n\nOver the past year the Army has been preparing for a radical transformation.\n\nIt wants to embrace new technologies - from drones and robots to artificial intelligence.\n\nBrig John Clark, the head of Army strategy, insists no decision on troop numbers has yet been made.\n\nBut he says by harnessing technology \"you're able to achieve the same effect with fewer people\".\n\nHowever, Jack Watling, of London's Royal United Services Institute warns of \"the excitement of new capabilities coming at the expense of traditional hard military power\".\n\nRemember, the majority of soldiers in a modern army are there to support and sustain a fighting force.\n\nThe tip of the spear, the combat element, is often about a third of an army's total strength.\n\nThe rumours in Whitehall suggest the Army will be losing several infantry battalions, part of the fighting force.\n\nMr Watling says an army of just 72,000 should still be able to take and hold \"a small town\", bearing in mind the British army struggled to secure the Iraqi city of Basra, when it was 100,000 strong.\n\nIt might appear to be a contradiction, but the Army believes even if it's smaller, it can still have a bigger presence around the world.\n\nIt's embraced the government's mantra of \"global Britain\".\n\nFor the Army it'll mean operating from a number of \"global hubs\" in parts of the world where it already has a presence - such as Kenya, Oman and Brunei.\n\nBrig Clark says: \"We see those as launchpads through which we can routinely send more of the British army out to train, develop and demonstrate.\"\n\nHe says by being forward-deployed the Army will be able to respond and manage threats \"more rapidly and decisively\".\n\nHe describes it as prevention rather than cure.\n\nIt signals a shift in the way the Army wants to operate.\n\nBrig Clark talks of \"smaller teams that can go out there and compete beneath the threshold of conflict\" - the so-called \"grey zone\" where militaries operate discreetly in the blurred lines between war and peace.\n\nBen Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: \"I see a clear aspiration to do more with the Army further away, but forces cannot be everywhere at once.\"\n\nThere are certainly questions as to whether a smaller army, spread around the world, will be able to meet its existing commitments to Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).\n\nIn theory, the UK can deploy a war fighting division to defend Europe.\n\nMr Watling of Rusi says among the components of a division would be around 200 main battle tanks.\n\nThe British army is likely to have half that number.\n\nMr Barry, of the IISS, says allies in eastern Europe are left wondering whether the British army of the future will be sending \"armour and infantry or aggressive algorithms\" to help defend them.\n\nThe Army's plans do include updating increasingly obsolete armoured vehicles and the addition of more potent long-range artillery systems.\n\nBrig Clark insists the Army will still be able to field a warfighting division.\n\nBut the Army's definition of a division appears to be changing.\n\nThe UK already has one of the smallest armies of any major European nation.\n\nAnd that worries its closest military ally, the United States.\n\nUS General Mark Milley's plea to the British army at a London conference just a few years ago was that \"you don't get any smaller\".\n\nKim Darroch, the former British ambassador to Washington, recently said the message from the Pentagon was \"\u2026do not go down any further and expect to retain your current credibility\".\n\nThe truth is that the British Army's credibility had already been damaged in the eyes of the US.\n\nAmerica had to come to the rescue of the British army in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMr Barry and Mr Watling also question whether an army of 72,000 could do another Helmand - a long, enduring campaign.\n\nBut the British army has a recent history of biting off more than it can chew.",

            "description": "Boris Johnson says \"the safety of the British people must come first\" as he outlines a new package.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "A \"once-in-a-generation modernisation\" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said.\n\nThe prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles.\n\n\"I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,\" he said.\n\nLabour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded.\n\nOutlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video link as he is self-isolating - said the benefits \"will go far beyond our armed forces\".\n\nMr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth \u00a316.5bn in new money over four years.\n\nHowever economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of \u00a316.5bn was a \"misleading way to present this announcement\".\n\nHe continued: \"It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be \u00a37bn higher than it would have been under previous plans.\"\n\nMr Johnson said: \"Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe.\"\n\nThe PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as \"the foremost naval power in Europe\" with a \"renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK\".\n\nHe also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as:\n\n\"From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,\" Mr Johnson added.\n\nThis is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past.\n\nThe Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm.\n\nBoris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs.\n\nThe extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber.\n\nDespite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a \u00a313bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made.\n\nThe MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely.\n\nAnd good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments - there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a \"spending announcement without a strategy\" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both.\n\nMr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was \"very thin indeed\".\n\nFormer foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson \"not to listen to any voices in his ear\" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending.\n\nAnd Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to \"quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment\" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, \"now and going forwards\".\n\nThe PM responded by telling the Commons: \"I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue.\"\n\nGen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" by the announcement.\n\n\"But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said \"letting go\" of some older weapons would create \"headroom\" for new investment.\n\nHe added: \"When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities.\"\n\nThe funding announcement is part of the first conclusions of the government's Integrated Review which looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy.\n\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give \"a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline\".\n\nConservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: \"This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces.\"\n\nBut he said the \"key takeaway\" for him was the \"message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability\".",

            "content": "The foreign secretary has warned democracy is \"in retreat\", in a speech setting out his vision for the UK's role in the world.\n\nDominic Raab argued democracies face their greatest threat since the end of the Cold War.\n\nHe said that is why countries like Britain should try to be a \"force for good in the world\".\n\nIt comes as the government faces criticism over the UK's future relationship with China.\n\nThe Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy set out by the government yesterday plans to increase the cap on the UK's stockpile of nuclear weapons.\n\nIt also said Britain would shift its focus towards Indo-Pacific countries, while pledging to tackle the \"systemic challenge\" of China.\n\nSpeaking to the US Aspen Security Forum, Mr Raab predicted in the next decade, the combined wealth of autocratic regimes is likely to exceed that of the world's democracies.\n\n\"Think about what that means for a second,\" he said.\n\n\"Tyranny is richer than freedom, and that matters to us here at home.\n\n\"Because stable, freedom-respecting democracies are much less likely to go to war, house terrorists or trigger large scale flows of migrants and they are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with, and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems.\"\n\nHe said the UK has \"a moral responsibility and an indivisible stake in our planet, our global economy, our global ecosystem and the conditions of peace and stability that underpin them\".\n\nAnd he argued that the UK \"can and should help alleviate the worst suffering in the world\".\n\nResponding to the review on Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of overseeing an \"era of retreat,\" with armed forces cuts \"every year for the last decade\".\n\nAnd he also said the UK's policy towards China had been \"inconsistent\" and accused the government of turning \"a blind eye\" to human rights abuses in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Raab has faced criticism after apparently telling officials the UK should trade with countries not meeting European Convention on Human Rights standards, in a leaked clip obtained by HuffPost UK.\n\nThe Foreign Office said the recording was selectively clipped to distort the comments of the foreign secretary who, it said, had emphasised the importance of promoting human rights.\n\nThe government is facing internal Conservative pressure to harden its stance on China over issues including its clampdown on Uighur Muslims and democratic rights in Hong Kong.\n\nThe review said the UK should \"continue to pursue a positive trade and investment relationship\" with the country - prompting some criticism from backbenchers.\n\nSenior Tory Julian Lewis took issue with its description of China as a \"partner,\" adding it suggested suggested the \"grasping naivety\" of the party's approach under David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne, when it actively sought Chinese investment, \"still lingers on\".\n\nBut giving evidence to a Lords committee on Wednesday, Mr Osborne defended his approach, arguing the UK should not take a \"dramatically different\" stance on Chinese investment.\n\nHe told peers the UK was \"more likely to get a hearing\" over its human rights concerns by \"engaging\" with China economically.\n\nHe added that forcing China to \"engage with the world\" was likely to improve British security in the long-run.\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also defended the government's approach, arguing that to \"pull up the drawbridge\" would not be \"productive\" when it comes to rights issues.\n\n\"You can trade with a country and at the same time make very strong representations about their mistreatment of minorities and their human rights abuses,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Queens Park Rangers has now removed Football Index sponsorship from its shirts.\n\nA group of MPs has written to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling for a public inquiry into the collapse of gambling website Football Index.\n\nThey say it is \"a scandal\" and shows the need to reform the gambling sector.\n\nThe firm has suspended operations and appointed administrators, sparking an outcry from punters whose money is still locked up in the business.\n\nThere are reports gamblers could lose more than \u00a390m, with some now seeking legal advice about possible claims.\n\nIn their letter, the MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Gambling Related Harm estimate that Football Index punters have lost \u00a33,000 each on average.\n\n\"This can only be termed a scandal,\" said chair Carolyn Harris. \"It underlines the need for wholesale reform of the gambling industry and raises significant questions of the Gambling Commission, given they saw fit to licence this platform and failed to enact adequate oversight.\"\n\nNot only does there need to be a urgent inquiry, it is more evidence of the need to create a Gambling Ombudsman to help protect consumers, she said.\n\nBen, aged 22, estimates the collapse in the value of his Football Index portfolio will cost him close to \u00a36,500.\n\n\"I feel embarrassed and cheated,\" he told the BBC. \"The crash has affected me mentally.\"\n\nHe lives at home and has no dependents, so thinks he got off lightly. \"There are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse; lost far more than me.\n\n\"I'll never trust Football Index again. I will go elsewhere and enjoy my love of football with other companies and probably bet in a more conventional way. But it will make me think twice before putting money into other companies.\n\n\"Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index.\" Punters feel the company has \"stitched up their loyal fan base\", he said.\n\nFootball Index hit serious financial problems earlier this month. The company cut dividend pay-outs on players, sparking a crash in their \"share\" price value.\n\nThis change in the terms and conditions meant the value of gamblers' portfolios plummeted, with many users taking to social media to report losses of thousands of pounds - even tens of thousands.\n\nSeveral punters contacted the BBC with reports of the impact on their finances, and called for action against the company and the regulator, the Gambling Commission.\n\nA group of gamblers has formed an action group, and on Tuesday it was announced that law firm Leigh Day is looking into possible legal action against Football Index parent company BetIndex on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money.\n\nLeigh Day partner Nichola Marshall said the role of the Gambling Commission will also come under scrutiny.\n\nMs Marshall said: \"Whilst it is very early days in our investigations on behalf of the thousands of people who have lost money, there are serious questions which will need answering regarding what has happened at Football Index and what the Gambling Commission understood of Football Index's activities.\"\n\nMatt Zarb-Cousin of the Clean Up Gambling campaign, who is working with Football Index customers and Leigh Day, said: \"Football Index ended up in a situation where they needed new customers to honour the dividend payments to existing users.\n\n\"It was a business run in an entirely unsustainable way, which people do not expect of a licensed operator in a regulated sector. The Gambling Commission has been asleep at the wheel.\"\n\nFast-growing Football Index launched in 2015 and allowed users to buy what it called \"shares\" in professional footballers. The firm paid users \"dividends\" according to player performances.\n\nIf a player performed well or transferred to a bigger club, the transfer value went up and so did the \"share price\".\n\nThe aim for users was to identify rising stars, buying shares in them while still relatively cheap before selling at a profit after their values rose.\n\nFootball Index called itself a \"challenge to traditional bookmakers\" and an alternative to the regular stock market which it said could \"seem intimidating and inaccessible\".\n\nBut although it used the terminology of the stock market, Football Index was regulated by the Gambling Commission, not the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nIn an update on Tuesday about the administration, BetIndex said it still hoped the company could \"be rescued as a going concern\". It added: \"Our priority is to safeguard the interests of our customers and to seek the best outcome for our community with the goal of continuing the platform in a restructured form.\"\n\nThe BBC has asked the Gambling Commission for comment. Last week the regulator said it was carrying out its own inquiries, pointing out it had concerns Football Index was not operating \"in accordance with a condition of its licence\".",

He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology.\n\nAnd, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom.\n\nMinisters argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad.\n\nThe test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people.\n\n\"So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people.\"\n\nHe added that the UK's \"international ambitions must start at home\", with investment in regional industry \"ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world\".\n\nThe government has said \"further jobs\" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England.\n\nIt has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by \u00a36.6bn in real terms, but, since then, it has increased by \u00a33bn in real terms.\n\nA report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries.\n\nIt described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as \"woeful\" and criticised what it called \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" over the past two decades.\n\nIn a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are\".\n\nHe added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\".",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "A man with learning difficulties who admitted to a murder 30 years ago should have his conviction quashed because he confessed to police without a lawyer present, his solicitor says.\n\nCampbell, who was 19 at the time, says he was \"put under pressure\" to \"admit to something that I didn't do\".\n\nPolice say the interviews were fair, while a judge ruled them admissible.\n\nMr Mullinger believes officers failed to tell him that his client - who was accused of shooting dead a London shopkeeper - had waived his right to a solicitor because they realised that he would try to change Campbell's mind.\n\nHe told Newsnight: \"The police did not have anything like sufficient evidence, probably even to get a prosecution off the ground, let alone a conviction without something more. And the more was going to be a confession.\"\n\nCampbell, 50, who suffered a brain injury when he was eight months old, has always protested his innocence and has been fighting his conviction for many years. He was released from prison on life licence in 2002.\n\nOn 22 July 1990, two men entered a shop in east London intent on robbery. The owner, 42-year-old Baldev Hoondle, pressed a panic alarm before one of the men pulled out a gun and shot him in the head at close range.\n\nNewsnight approached Mr Hoondle's family but they did not wish to participate in the programme.\n\nShopkeeper Baldev Hoondle was murdered in his off-licence in July 1990\n\nCampbell - a local teenager - was arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and brought in for questioning at Hackney police station.\n\nOn 1 December 1990, Mr Mullinger attended a police interview with his client alongside an appropriate adult from social services who was there because the police accepted that Campbell was mentally vulnerable.\n\nMr Mullinger and the appropriate adult left at around 6.30pm thinking interviews were over for the day, with Mr Mullinger saying that police officers had agreed to call him back if that changed.\n\nThe police say Campbell then decided to confess to murder and had waived his right to a solicitor.\n\nOfficers then brought his foster mother in to the police station and she agreed to become the appropriate adult for the new interview, which went ahead without Mr Mullinger's knowledge.\n\nHe told Newsnight he was misled and believes the police realised that getting a confession would be less likely if Campbell was legally represented.\n\nHe said: \"The officer should have telephoned me and said, 'I think Oliver wants to speak to me. Will you come over to be part of the interview?' And I would have said, 'yes, of course'\u2026 And we would have had the interview.\n\n\"I don't know how that interview would have panned out, but it would have been undoubtedly a fair interview.\"\n\nArthur Mullinger believes Campbell's conviction should be quashed because the confession would be ruled inadmissible today\n\nCampbell's foster mother, who was a magistrate, was so shocked by his confession to murder that she was physically sick. She said at the time that she felt manipulated by the police.\n\nNewsnight obtained the original tapes of the police interviews conducted and traced the senior officer who interviewed Campbell in 1990.\n\nThe officer, who the BBC is choosing not to name, denies that the interview was unfair and told Newsnight he suspects Campbell is \"in denial of murder\", adding: \"When he was interviewed by me, he had the assistance of a solicitor or an appropriate adult to look after him...\n\n\"It is correct he did not have a solicitor present when he confessed. However, his appropriate adult was present throughout and he had waived his right to have his solicitor.\"\n\nHe added: \"His interview tape recordings were played at his trial and the jury had ample opportunity to consider whether or not his confession was genuine\", and said this was \"not the only evidence which incriminated him\".\n\nThe officer said the interviews were tape recorded and conducted in accordance with the Codes of Practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which applied at that time.\n\nBut Mr Mullinger and Campbell's current legal team say his conviction should be quashed because the confession would be ruled inadmissible today.\n\nGlyn Maddocks and Michael Birnbaum have been fighting to clear Campbell's name for the past 20 years.\n\nOliver Campbell was 19 years old when he was convicted of murder in 1991\n\nMr Maddocks said: \"Oliver Campbell is a mentally disabled person who was no match for a group of experienced and manipulative police officers.\n\n\"The 'admissions' Oliver made were inconsistent, varied noticeably from the evidence and in some places were quite absurd.\"\n\nMr Birnbaum QC said: \"I can't prove this - this is a strong suspicion [but] I think they realised that they were never going to get an admission from him if a solicitor was present.\"\n\nCampbell's confession statements were ruled admissible at his trial in 1991. Mr Birnbaum QC told Newsnight: \"The trial judge conducted a hearing about whether to admit that statement - declare it admissible - and said that there had been no impropriety by the police.\n\n\"But I don't believe the defence counsel brought up any of these to my mind pretty obvious points that could be made about the unfairness of the police conduct.\"\n\nThe prosecution relied on three main strands of evidence apart from Campbell's confession:\n\nBut Campbell's lawyers say his confession was key, and there was no solicitor present for that.\n\nCampbell was released from prison after serving 11 years in 2002 and is now living in sheltered accommodation in Suffolk. He is still a convicted murderer, a label he says is ruining his life.\n\nHe told Newsnight that the police questioning was unfair, adding: \"I was put under pressure\u2026 to say things that I didn't want to say at the end of the day\u2026 to admit to something that I didn't do. And I felt scared at the time.\"\n\nSome of the police interview tactics were later described by an independent psychologist as \"highly manipulative and relentless\", while one of the questions lasted almost three minutes.\n\nThe case is now being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for the second time. In 2005, it decided not to refer it back to the Court of Appeal. A key reason for this was that it argued that many of the apparent weaknesses in evidence had already been considered by the courts.\n\nMr Birnbaum QC says there are fresh grounds today, both on the detail of the evidence and the circumstances surrounding Campbell's confession.\n\nHe said: \"The law and practise in regard to the way that mentally challenged suspects and defendants are treated has changed very considerably in their favour.\n\n\"Today his interviews would never be heard by a jury because of the unfairness of the police questioning and because I don't think the prosecution could prove that he understood the implications of being interviewed without a solicitor.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"The case was fully investigated at the time with a range of evidence brought before a jury who convicted the defendant in 1991.\n\n\"We are aware this matter is with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.\"\n\nWatch the full report on Newsnight at 22:45 GMT on Tuesday 16 March on BBC 2 or later on iPlayer.",

            "content": "St Patrick's Day celebrations will once again be different this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTraditional parades in Belfast and Dublin have been cancelled for the second year in a row, with many events across the island again moving online.\n\nPolice have warned that anyone breaking Covid-19 regulations in NI will face a \"robust\" response.\n\nBut while large gatherings are mostly ruled out, attempts have been made to celebrate in style around the world.\n\nWhen the Global Greenings initiative was first launched, just the Sydney Opera House and the Sky Tower in Auckland took part\n\nSince 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, a record number of places are taking part.\n\nSome 670 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative.\n\nThe quirkiest additions to this year's list include an abandoned sauna in Finland and a Smurf statue in Brussels.\n\nHere's how other places in Northern Ireland and further afield are planning to mark the occasion:\n\nBelfast has an array of virtual events for people to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes throughout the month of March.\n\nAn online disco, Irish language festivals and a virtual guided tour of the city's street art are just some of the events on offer.\n\nSeveral live music events will also be streamed throughout St Patrick's Day, showcasing the city's talent.\n\nSt Joseph's Church in Sailortown is one such venue celebrating with an eight-hour live-streamed event.\n\nThe St Patrick's Centre in Downpatrick, County Down is celebrating with a number of online events for St Patrick's Day and also to mark its 20 year anniversary.\n\nA new show about St Patrick, a children's virtual art competition and a series of podcasts from former BBC politics correspondent Martina Purdy and ex-barrister Elaine Kelly, who are pilgrim guides on the new St Patrick's Way, are just some of the events on offer.\n\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Purdy said that some of the guests involved on the podcast are journalist and presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as Irish cellist Patrick Dexter, who has found online fame with his open-air recitals, shot outside his cottage in County Mayo.\n\n\"I was probably less aggressive than I was previously with some politicians,\" she said.\n\nIt is claimed that St Patrick is buried outside Downpatrick Cathedral. A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century.\n\nThe council's Spring and St Patrick's Day programme promises to \"bring some colour\" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney.\n\nHe thanked event organisers for a programme that \"strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe\".\n\nEvent organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: \"While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise\".\n\nArmagh's At Home With St Patrick Festival includes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class.\n\nAll events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance.\n\nThe council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with a series of online performances and storytelling.\n\nAll events have moved online and the festival includes music and dance performances, streamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.\n\nThe council is streaming a series of craft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances live on social media channels throughout the day.\n\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland for St Patrick's Day\n\nPolice in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations.\n\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday.\n\nThe substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast.\n\nPolice said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines.\n\nSaint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\n\nWhile St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ.\n\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March, with more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland.\n\nOrganisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 for the virtual parade.\n\nThe celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said.\n\nThe Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\n\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.\"\n\nL\u00e1 Fh\u00e9ile P\u00e1draig sona daoibh go l\u00e9ir\n\n\n\nAhead of #StPatricksDay tomorrow, The Queen has sent her best wishes to the people of Ireland \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/FQv88xVz5q\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Her Majesty is pictured with @PresidentIRL and during her historic visit to Ireland in 2011. pic.twitter.com/4OKpaAp74v \u2014 The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) March 16, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

            "content": "Covid-19: What do Northern Ireland latest statistics tell us?\n\nNorthern Ireland continues to edge closer to the lifting of lockdown.\n\nThe how and when is a decision for the executive but what do the statistics associated with the pandemic tell us?\n\nFor weeks now, things have been going - if not well - a lot better than they were when we entered 2021.\n\nInfection rates are down, there are fewer people in hospital, and while there have been days when the number of deaths has risen, the death rate remains relatively low.\n\nAdded to that is the ongoing rollout of the vaccination programme - this has been going well and is expected to step up to another level in the next few weeks with opening of the mass vaccination centre at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\n\nThe infection rate in Northern Ireland has fallen to about 64 cases per 100,000 of the population.\n\nWales has the lowest infection rate in the UK.\n\nEngland, Scotland and Northern Ireland are all very similar - although, while Scotland and England's have fallen in recent days, Northern Ireland's infection rate has actually risen slightly.\n\nHowever, the rates remain relatively low.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland has a slightly higher infection rate at the moment and has risen marginally over the past few days.\n\nHere are the seven-day infection rates for the UK and Ireland up until March 12:\n\nOver the past few weeks, increasing numbers of people have been getting tested in Northern Ireland - more than 30,000 a week now - and over the same period of time, we've seen a drop in the number of positive cases.\n\nIn the past week, about one in every 25 people tested have received a positive result for Covid-19; compare that with the start of January, when more than one in four people were getting a positive result.\n\nOr here's another way of looking at this - on average fewer than 200 people are testing positive for the virus in Northern Ireland each day.\n\nThat is a massive change from our peak in January when there was an average of more than 1,800 positive results per day.\n\nGiven that we're now testing roughly the same number of people each day as we were back in mid-January, the comparison is fairly straightforward.\n\nDespite the overall low infection rate for Northern Ireland, there are places where the rates are higher.\n\nFor example, based on Department of Health data, Mid Ulster has still the highest infection rate of all the council areas in Northern Ireland, and it's risen slightly over the past week.\n\nIt's not alone in seeing rising infection rates.\n\nAntrim and Newtownabbey; Belfast; Causeway Coast and Glens; Lisburn and Castlereagh; and Newry, Mourne and Down have all seen small increases in their infection rates.\n\nHowever, the department indicates that the Ards and North Down Borough Council area has seen a substantial rise in its rate of virus spread - by about 50%.\n\nIts infection rate is now above 80 cases per 100,000 population, making it the third worst in Northern Ireland (Belfast is in second spot).\n\nMore localised analysis suggests higher infection rates in areas around Strabane, Dundonald, Holywood and parts of south Belfast.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, certain border areas have seen a decrease in infections - most notably Cavan and Leitrim.\n\nDonegal, Monaghan and Louth have all seen falling rates, although Louth still has one of the higher infection rates in the Republic.\n\nThe number of people in Northern Ireland's hospitals with Covid-19 is now below 200. The last time the figure was this low was in early October.\n\nThe daily admissions have been similarly falling.\n\nThe current seven-day rolling average for daily hospital admissions in Northern Ireland is 10.\n\nFor context, at the peak in January, we could expect nearly 100 Covid-positive patients to be admitted into hospital each day.\n\nThese low admission numbers, along with lower infection rates indicate that the numbers of inpatients with Covid should continue to fall, at least in the short term.\n\nBear in mind that these numbers could start to rise, especially if localised increases in infection rates become more widespread.\n\nStill, our hospitals remain under quite a bit of pressure, with occupancy at 95%. The yearly average hospital occupancy in Northern Ireland has consistently been about 84% for a number of years.\n\nNorthern Ireland currently has fewer than 30 patients with Covid in intensive care units (ICU) - at 23, it's the lowest number for this measure in five months.\n\nThe number of ICU patients is important, as it gives some idea of how many people with the virus are very seriously ill.\n\nA recent report by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) reveals some details of the type of patients that have been in ICU in Northern Ireland over the course of the pandemic.\n\nThe report looks at data from the start of the pandemic until 31 August and then from 1 September to 4 March.\n\nIt shows that about 70% of ICU patients with Covid have been men. The vast majority of ICU patients with the virus have been classed as overweight.\n\nThe age profile of ICU patients with Covid has been around 60 on average.\n\nAnd the figures in the report indicate that the poorest people in society have been more likely to end up in ICU suffering from Covid-19.\n\nThis is consistent with many other trends in health statistics which show that the most deprived are frequently the most adversely affected.\n\nNorthern Ireland's death rate has increased slightly since the start of March.\n\nBy the beginning of the month, the seven-day rolling average death rate had dipped to two - equivalent to the start of October, before the winter surge started in earnest.\n\nOver the past week it has been sitting at four.\n\nThe general downward trend in the death rate has been reflected for six weeks in a row by the figures published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra).\n\nBased on the deaths counted by health departments across the UK (deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 result) Northern Ireland has had the fewest deaths by population since the start of the pandemic:\n\nThe Republic of Ireland records deaths slightly differently than the health authorities in the UK - probable and possible deaths are included in Ireland, which makes it much more akin to the weekly number recorded by Nisra.\n\nHowever, based on the number published by the Irish government, 90 people have died for every 100,000 in the state - less than half the rate of the United Kingdom.\n\nThis indicates that Ireland has had a lower death rate than the UK, but Northern Ireland's is closer to the Republic of Ireland's than to Britain's.\n\nAnother way of looking at deaths is to examine the number of fatalities in comparison to the number of people who test positive for the virus.\n\nThis measure reinforces the picture of the island of Ireland having had a different death rate than Britain:\n\nThe UK's rolling average death rate has now fallen below countries such as France and the United States.\n\nHowever, the UK still has one of the world's worst recorded cumulative death rates for the whole pandemic.\n\nMore than 600,000 people in Northern Ireland have now received a vaccine - and that number continues to climb.\n\nMeasured by sheer volume, the vaccination programme continues to be a success.\n\nAbout one in three people in Northern Ireland have had a Covid vaccine jab.\n\nThis is slightly less than the comparative percentages for the rest of the UK, but is still very impressive in the space of three months.\n\nIn terms of Northern Ireland's adult population, almost 43% has received a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's vaccination is still some way behind Northern Ireland's.\n\nAbout 8% of the population in the Republic of Ireland has been vaccinated.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ireland has adopted a different strategy to the UK, and has not concentrated so much on first doses.\n\nMore than a third of those vaccinated in the Republic have already received their second dose.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the numbers of people receiving their second dose each day have not been predictable, but it looks like the numbers are starting to increase, albeit from quite a low base.\n\nSo far, almost 50,000 people in Northern Ireland have had their second dose of vaccine.\n\nThis week, the Department of Health launched a new dashboard specifically to record the progress of the vaccination programme.\n\nAt the minute, it mostly brings together data that was available from a variety of other platforms, but there are plans to improve it, according to Health Minister Robin Swann.\n\n\"It is the first step in plans to publish detailed daily data on vaccinations and a more comprehensive dashboard is currently in preparation,\" he said.\n\n\"I am committed to improving the regular flow of information on the programmes because this will help us to chart our progress as the programme advances through the various age groups.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that almost half the vaccines given out in Northern Ireland have been administered by GPs.\n\nThe main bits of new data on the dashboard are the numbers of healthcare workers who have received a vaccine - about 125,000.\n\nAt the time the dashboard was launched, healthcare workers and care home workers accounted for about one in four of the first dose vaccines administered in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe new dashboard does not give any data on uptake rates, however - that is, the number of people who were offered a vaccine; numbers of those who took it; and numbers of those who didn't.\n\nThis data, once available, will give decision makers the ability to try to target particular areas or groups in attempts to improve the uptake of vaccines.",

            "content": "A group of 47 cancer charities says that without urgent action, the UK's cancer death rate will rise for the first time in decades.\n\nNHS figures suggest tens of thousands fewer people started cancer treatment since the first lockdown compared to normal times.\n\nOne Cancer Voice says that the NHS needs more resources.\n\nThe government says cancer treatment remains a top priority and urges people to see their GP if they have symptoms.\n\nRadio 1 Newsbeat has spoken exclusively to One Cancer Voice about the impact of coronavirus on cancer care.\n\nThe group of charities also wants to see more staff available to diagnose and treat cancer, with greater NHS access to private facilities in order to \"clear the backlog\".\n\n\"We are calling on the government to invest more money in ensuring the backlog of cancer cases is reduced and eliminated,\" says Michelle Mitchell, the boss of Cancer Research UK, which heads up One Cancer Voice.\n\n\"We could face, in this country today, the prospect of cancer survival reducing for the first time in decades. That's why urgent action is required by the government.\"\n\nGeorge says: \"We'll see how we go on chemotherapy. And if it stops working, or slows down, we have a few other options\"\n\nOne Cancer Voice estimates that millions of people have had their cancer care affected in some way by the pandemic. Newsbeat's spent the last three months speaking to some of those.\n\nGeorge Hatfield, 20, was told by doctors he's one of the youngest patients ever diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.\n\nHaving been on different treatments of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, George, from Hampshire, was considered for surgery because of the \"good response\" he was showing.\n\nBut he says in the pandemic, that all changed, with doctors hesitant to press ahead.\n\n\"They didn't want to put me at an even higher risk of catching Covid and getting seriously ill. I was already immunosuppressed by my drugs.\"\n\nGeorge admits thinking about how things might have been different without a pandemic, which has effectively taken away a treatment option.\n\n\"When having lots of options is your positive thing and suddenly one gets taken away, it's quite worrying,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\nGeorge says his future is very much a case of taking \"every day as it comes\" and not looking too far ahead.\n\n\"I look a bit further now. When I first started, I didn't look past three weeks but now I look at what plans I've got for the end of the year.\"\n\nHe feels his experience has been made worse by things he was looking forward to being stopped.\n\n\"Occasionally, I do get very frustrated with everything. And it feels like the entire universe is out to get you and make things as difficult as possible for you.\n\n\"But I think sometimes you just have to not dwell on things too much and take things as they come.\"\n\nCraig says: \"It just isn't right. It's not part of the natural order that you see somebody at that age, going through what she went through\"\n\nIt was being well-managed by chemotherapy, according to Craig, but because of the pandemic, she was advised to have a 12-week break in her treatment due to the risk of catching the virus at hospital.\n\nShe died 12 weeks later, aged 31, leaving behind her now seven-year-old son, Finnley.\n\n\"From Kelly's point of view, chemotherapy was keeping her alive so it was best to deal with that first,\" Craig, from Macclesfield, says.\n\n\"We believe staying on the chemotherapy may have given her a month, three months, six months or longer.\n\n\"When you've got a young son, that's all the time in the world.\n\n\"You should never hear somebody of that age, especially somebody you love, coming out with the words that they don't want to die and they're terrified.\"\n\nKelly's son Finnley was six when she passed away\n\nCraig says Kelly would be angered by the way the pandemic has hit other people's cancer care.\n\n\"First of all, obviously, Kelly's care was impacted, and in my opinion, led to her premature death.\n\n\"She fought for the rights of cancer patients to be heard and treated. At the moment neither is happening.\n\n\"In my view, the government has completely neglected cancer patients in this country.\"\n\nThe government says: \"Cancer diagnosis and treatment has remained a top priority throughout the pandemic, with 1.86m urgent referrals and over 477,000 people receiving cancer treatment between March 2020 and January 2021.\n\n\"We continue to urge people to come forward to their GP if they have symptoms. As part of our additional investment in the NHS, an extra \u00a31bn is being used to boost diagnosis and treatment across all areas of elective care in the year ahead.\"\n\nOne Cancer Voice estimates at least 43,700 fewer people got treatment for cancer from April 2020 compared to the equivalent period before the pandemic.\n\nThat's based on stats from the health services in England (April to January 2021), Wales (April to December 2020), Scotland and Northern Ireland (both April to September 2020).\n\nSophie's been having cancer treatment since 2015\n\nSophie Mulligan from Liverpool is in remission from leukaemia.\n\nHer joints have been left damaged, meaning she lives in a lot of pain and is facing a long wait for surgery.\n\nThe 24-year-old's white blood cells had to be flown to America for treatment. Normally, the process for cells would take around four weeks, but Sophie had to wait longer.\n\nShe was concerned about whether her cancer would spread in those extra few weeks.\n\nSophie's treatments have left her with bone tissue damage\n\n\"I saw people moaning about trivial things, like not being able to go out and see friends or go to the pub,\" she says.\n\n\"And I'm thinking, this is a life or death situation for me, that is totally different.\"\n\nWith all the treatments she's had over the years, Sophie has developed a condition called avascular necrosis - which is the death of bone tissue.\n\n\"And that affects my hip joints, shoulder joints, elbow and wrist.\n\n\"It means that I am very restricted in mobility, I suffer from horrendous pain and it affects my day-to-day life.\"\n\n\"I'm not a normal 24-year-old by any means,\" says Sophie\n\nThe pandemic means that there's a long wait for the surgery, and instead, Sophie is having to manage with painkillers and not leaving her house.\n\nAnd while lots of people Sophie's age will be thinking about the country emerging from lockdown, she just wants to be pain-free.\n\n\"I'm more bothered about going back into hospital to have surgery so that I can live some form of a normal life again.\"\n\n\"I think I'm an example of how the NHS should actually be working,\" Toyin says\n\nBut not every cancer patient has had a bad experience during the pandemic.\n\nToyin Coker was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer the week before her 28th birthday, but is now in remission.\n\n\"I haven't had any appointments rescheduled, I haven't had any issues at all, every single treatment was right on time,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Toyin, from London, admits to feeling \"absolutely petrified\".\n\n\"You think about if the surgery or treatment is postponed, and how your body would react to that.\n\n\"You don't know if the delays will make your cancer worse, because I've never dealt with it before.\"\n\n\"It's the fear of not knowing what's going to happen\"\n\nSo she understands the fear many other cancer patients have felt during this time.\n\n\"It's very scary to hear the issues that other people are facing, because this is a life-or-death situation.\n\n\"You've got family members that are worrying as well. So it's a lot more than the person dealing with cancer.\"\n\nFor now, Toyin feels stronger \"and in a very good place.\n\n\"And I'm just really happy to be to be given the all-clear. I'm grateful and feel blessed.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

            "content": "Bakery chain Greggs is to open 100 new shops in 2021 as it bets on a post-pandemic recovery.\n\nThis is despite the chain reporting its first loss for 36 years in 2020 after sales fell by a third amid coronavirus lockdown measures.\n\nGreggs said it had ramped up deliveries, wholesale, and click-and-collect as High Street sales fell.\n\nChief executive Roger Whiteside added that Greggs had \"made a better-than-expected start to 2021\".\n\nHe added that the chain was \"well placed to participate in the recovery from the pandemic\".\n\nSales at company-managed shops fell by more than 36% last year as footfall in city centres and travel hub sites fell substantially during lockdowns.\n\nThis was partly offset by deliveries through Just Eat, which is one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms.\n\nGreggs reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a313.7m, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984.\n\nNevertheless, the chain is planning to open about 100 net new shops this year, adding to the 2,078 it already operates.\n\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pandemic \"tore a huge chunk off business as it turned once bustling city centres into ghost towns\".\n\n\"Although the crisis is likely to prove a temporary interruption to our insatiable demand for sausage rolls rather than a sign of dramatically changing tastes, it is quite a sustained break, and it's going to take a toll. Greggs has previously said it doesn't expect a return to pre-Covid levels of operations until 2022 at the earliest.\"\n\nJohn Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: \"The High Street is likely to be a very different place when lockdown restrictions are fully ended, with many empty spaces and chains such as Pret re-focusing on suburban areas - the traditional heartland of Greggs.\n\n\"While these factors cannot be underestimated, the company is in good shape, with a solid balance sheet, and has a great record of rising to the challenge.\"\n\nGreggs chairman Ian Durant said 2020 was \"not the year that any of us planned for\".\n\nHe said the firm had started the year strongly but then temporarily closed its shops in March due to the Covid outbreak. It then reopened shops in the middle of the year.\n\nTo get through the pandemic, Greggs arranged financing both from the government, which it has since repaid, and from lenders.\n\n\"Government support has been essential to mitigate the impact of Covid and protect as many jobs as possible through this period,\" Mr Durant said.\n\nHe said it had been \"sad to say goodbye\" to staff whose roles had been cut by the firm \"to reflect the reality of the trading environment\".",

            "content": "'Thorntons says it's closing stores - but we're still open'\n\nMark and his son Henry, when he was a baby, outside the shop in Allestree, Derbyshire.\n\nMark Rees and his wife Katy run a chain of gift shops with the Thorntons name in big letters above the door.\n\nAnd they pay \u00a37,000 a year for the privilege.\n\nSo imagine their shock when the chocolate maker told them it would be issuing a global press release announcing its plans to close all of its 61 stores.\n\nWhat that announcement didn't say is that Thorntons' more than 100 franchisees - who, together, account for the bulk of its High Street presence - have no intention of closing.\n\nIn a subsequent statement to the BBC, Thorntons said: \"We proactively communicated with all our franchise partners this morning to reassure them that we remain committed to supporting them and continuing to supply their business with our Thorntons range.\"\n\nBut the couple have faced questions from staff who thought they were losing their jobs and customers who thought their shops would not reopen after lockdowns are lifted.\n\nFor Mark, it is the latest blow in a relationship that has seen him \"rode roughshod over\" for 15 years by Thorntons.\n\nHis parents started the chain of shops 30 years ago when they spent tens of thousands of pounds to become a Thorntons partner.\n\nAnd it wasn't easy. To this day the chocolate maker has absolute say over what lighting Mark uses to illuminate its products and even what he puts on the floor in front of them.\n\nBut for his parents, it was worth it. Then, Mark says, it was a privilege to stock Thorntons products and it made their stores a destination for chocolate lovers.\n\nBut that changed in 2004, shortly after Mark took over the business.\n\nThe chocolate maker took its franchise partners by surprise by announcing that it would start selling its products in supermarkets and beyond. That meant Thorntons' loyal customers could get their Continental Selection boxes elsewhere - and for less.\n\nWhile Mark says he had to adhere to strict rules about how the product was displayed and how much he could charge, those same boxes were being \"bunged on to shelves\" at petrol stations and discount retailers.\n\n\"And yet, we are actually policed,\" Mark says. \"We could have our franchise agreement taken away, if we do not abide by the rules of the contract.\"\n\n\"They've ruled by fear in many ways,\" he says.\n\nThorntons shops that look like this will not reopen once lockdown restrictions are eased\n\nMeanwhile, Mark was able to walk into Wilko and buy Thorntons products for less than he was paying to the chocolate maker itself.\n\n\"It's damaging for us because customers see us as expensive, but we just simply cannot afford to sell the product any cheaper,\" Mark says.\n\nLast year, he was selling Easter eggs for \u00a38 that he was buying from Thorntons for \u00a35. At Wilko, that same egg was being sold for \u00a33.\n\nThat meant Mark was often forced to stock up at the discount retailer, rather than his \"supposed partner\", which is how he refers to Thorntons.\n\n\"You can imagine the damage and the hurt that that causes you,\" he says.\n\nKaty thinks the franchise partners, who are often family-run businesses that helped build the Thorntons brand in the 90s, have been \"completely forgotten and now left to fight for their survival\".\n\nMeanwhile, she accuses Thorntons of \"flooding\" supermarket shelves with its chocolates and cheapening the brand that franchisees like her and Mark pay so much to buy in to.\n\nAs a result, the couple have decided to rebrand their stores to Henry & Co, named after their son.\n\nThe Rees family in their newly-rebranded Henry & Co shop\n\n\"We have decided that the alliances that we have with these brands, is actually damaging us and not benefiting us at all,\" Mark says.\n\n\"We're going to break away from the shackles of dealing with these big brands and the onerous contracts and constraints that that brings with it.\"\n\nA Thorntons spokeswoman said: \"In addition to our own retail estate, we work closely with around 100 other franchise stores that sell Thorntons product within a broader retail store environment - such as cards stores, gift stores and post offices.\"\n\n\"Our franchise partners, alongside our grocery partners and e-commerce, remain a key part of our strategy for the future of Thorntons. The Thorntons website store locator will continue to reflect the franchise stores available to customers.\"",

            "content": "Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted.\n\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\n\nThat date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that \"brighter days are ahead of us\".\n\nThe \"stay at home\" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to \"stay local\" for a further three weeks.\n\nOther changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April.\n\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\n\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\n\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\n\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that:\n\nA decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept \"under ongoing review\".\n\nShe told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest.\n\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\n\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".\n\nHowever, she said she was \"optimistic\" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues.\n\n\"This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,\" she said.\n\nRestrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or \"as soon as possible thereafter\".\n\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus.\n\nShe said that \"our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that\" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place \"for some time to come\".\n\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome.\n\nHowever, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments.\n\nAnd she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can \"get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear\".\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed \"effective testing and tracing\" systems to keep infections low.\n\nHe called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that \"transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close\".\n\nData not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland.\n\nThe first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic.\n\nToday, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme.\n\nBut the first minister said this was the \"most hopeful\" she had felt for a long time and that \"something much closer to actual normality\" might be achieved as we move into summer.\n\nThe change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown.\n\nMs Sturgeon said the government had to make \"careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions\" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving \"steadily and in one direction\".\n\nThe final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the \"need for medium term-support\". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year.\n\nScottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was \"most welcome for everyone\", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses.\n\nMs Sturgeon said that \"any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission\", and that \"we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can\".\n\nScottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the \"indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area\".\n\nThe first minister said everything was \"predicated on the data going in the right direction\", and that \"all bets are off\" if case numbers rise sharply again.\n\nShe told MSPs that her \"hope and ambition\" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month.",

            "content": "\"Immediate steps\" aimed at improving safety for women and girls in England and Wales have been announced by No 10 after Sarah Everard's death.\n\nAmong them is an additional \u00a325m for better lighting and CCTV as well as a pilot scheme which would see plain-clothes officers in pubs and clubs.\n\nCampaigners say the money is not enough and called for institutional changes.\n\nLabour said meaningful changes to law are needed rather than plans involving \"police officers in skinny jeans\".\n\nIt comes after hundreds of people protested in central London on Monday.\n\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\n\nHer body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old marketing executive's kidnap and murder.\n\nFollowing a meeting of the government's Crime and Justice Taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take \"immediate steps\" to give \"further reassurance\" to women and girls in the wake of the killing of Ms Everard.\n\nNo 10 said it would double the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to \u00a345m.\n\nUndercover police will be sent to clubs, bars and popular nightspots to relay intelligence about predatory or suspicious offenders to uniformed officers, in pilots of so-called Project Vigilant, rolled out across the country.\n\nSafeguarding minister Victoria Atkins said undercover officers working in the night-time economy would feed intelligence to uniformed officers.\n\nShe said the government would work with businesses and police to ensure, as the industry reopened following the coronavirus lockdown, \"that women can feel safe in our streets\".\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in \"landmark legislation\" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets.\n\nHe said: \"Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them.\"\n\nBut Labour's shadow domestic violence minister Jess Phillips told BBC Breakfast that in her years of experience, she had not come across experts or victims calling for more CCTV in public spaces.\n\nShe accused ministers of being \"caught on the hop\" and rolling out plans involving \"police officers in skinny jeans\" rather than meaningful changes to legislation regarding street harassment, or a detailed review of how rape is prosecuted in England and Wales.\n\nThe shadow home secretary, Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the measures were \"nowhere near good enough\" and called for \"urgent action\" on issues like harassment of women, domestic homicide sentencing and more support for victims of rape.\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more funding for better street lighting was not unwelcome, but \"it really just doesn't understand what the issues are\". She said measures focused on policing nightspots do not recognise \"that women get abused, assaulted and intimidated in all sorts of places\".\n\nDr Ellie Cosgrave, a lecturer in urban innovation and policy at University College London, said it was right that the government consider lighting as a way to help make cities safer, but added: \"You can't just shove a light in and hope that the public space will be better.\"\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that \"over-lighting\" some areas in a city can make other areas feel less safe.\n\nDr Cosgrave said the best action ministers can take to make cities safer is to understand the \"social dynamics\" of an area by conducting surveys, speaking to people, and implementing change based on what they say.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast it was good news that more women were feeling more confident to report rape allegations, but he added \"we still haven't done well enough to get the evidence that can secure convictions\".\n\nA spokeswoman for organisation Reclaim These Streets said it welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were \"so important\".\n\n\"Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,\" she said.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel had warned against holding vigils, and has launched a review into the policing of a gathering over the weekend in south London in memory of Ms Everard.\n\nDuring that event, officers handcuffed and removed several women after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects.\n\nOn Monday, hundreds marched across central London in what was said to be a meeting by Sisters Uncut, which describes itself as an \"intersectional feminist direct-action collective\", with many of those in attendance carrying placards.\n\nFour people were arrested - three on suspicion of breaching coronavirus regulations and a fourth on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker. A further two people were issued with fixed penalty notices, the Metropolitan Police said.\n\nProtests will be able to legally resume on 29 March, when the coronavirus \"stay at home\" order lifts in England.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said demonstrations will continue to be subject to Covid-secure precautions such as appropriate measures to maintain social distancing.\n\nMeanwhile, MPs will continue debating the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill later, which would change how protests are managed, including allowing police to impose conditions such as start and finish times.\n\nLabour has criticised the bill saying it did \"nothing to help women feel safer\", and imposed \"disproportionate\" controls on freedom of speech.\n\nMs Patel said the bill would end the halfway release of those convicted of sexual offences such as rape and also said the Domestic Abuse bill was on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, which she said would \"transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime\".",

If it was dropped down again, I'd like to see services provided in its place, but I'd rather it wasn't dropped.\"\n\nA former teacher, head teacher and chief executive of a school academy trust, Dame Rachel promised to be an \"independent voice, there to fight to protect and promote the rights of children\".\n\nIf government was \"doing something wrong\", she said, \"I will be fearless in exposing that and challenging them\".\n\nThe review will consider how children will recover from so much disrupted education - calculating that collectively pupils in England have lost 840 million days of in-person schooling since the start of the pandemic, representing about 19 weeks each.\n\nIt will address the \"social fault lines\" and inequalities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, between generations, the wealthy and the disadvantaged, by ethnicity and geography.\n\nFree school meals should be extended, says Dame Rachel\n\nThis includes how the gulf between rich and poor and young and old has widened, with older, higher earners increasing their savings in the lockdown, while poorer families and younger people have faced job losses and increasingly fragile finances.\n\nToday's young people are the first post-war generation to be less well-off than their parents, says the report launching the children's commissioner's review.\n\n\"As we emerge from the Covid pandemic, this is the moment for something big, for children to recognise the sacrifices they have made,\" said Dame Rachel.\n\n\"I have seen first-hand the effect of this crisis on young people's hopes and dreams, and sometimes our answers simply have not been good enough.\"\n\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said: \"Over the last decade the Conservatives have overseen record numbers of children being pushed into poverty, a worsening mental health crisis and an 18-month gap in learning between disadvantaged children and their peers at GCSE.\"\n\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We know that children and families have faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic.\n\n\"We've expanded frontline charity support and provided new resources for schools and teachers to support children and young people's mental health.\n\n\"Our \u00a31.7bn investment in recovery support will help tackle the impact of any lost learning and we are investing an additional \u00a379m to increase the number of mental health support teams working with schools and colleges.\"",

            "section": "Glasgow & West Scotland",
            "content": "Sales executive Moira, who was 40 when she was murdered in May 2008, and her mother Bea\n\nThe mother of a woman who was abducted and murdered in Glasgow has expressed her concern for Sarah Everard's family.\n\nBea Jones said she had been left \"distressed\" by the similarities between the case and what happened to her own daughter, Moira, in 2008.\n\nAnd she has urged the public to keep Sarah's loved ones in mind.\n\nBea wrote: \"We send love to them all and wish them all the strength they need to get through all the dark days ahead.\"\n\nMoira Jones was randomly abducted yards from her home and forced into nearby Queen's Park, where she was raped and beaten to death.\n\nSlovakian national Marek Harcar was jailed in 2009 for the murder and the judge set the punishment part of his life sentence at 25 years.\n\nLord Bracadale said the crime had \"shocked the nation\" and told Harcar: \"Your conduct that night reflects a level of wickedness very rarely encountered.\"\n\nIn a bid to cope with her loss, former teacher Bea wrote a harrowing diary, which last year featured in BBC Scotland documentary The Dark Shadow of Murder.\n\nShe also set up a charity, The Moira Fund, to help bereaved families.\n\nBea, from Weston, Staffordshire, decided to write a letter outlining her fears about the Sarah Everard case after receiving multiple media approaches for comment.\n\nMs Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, vanished as she walked home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in Kent woodland.\n\nSarah Everard has been described by her family as \"kind, thoughtful, caring and dependable\"\n\nBea wrote: \"We have been very distressed by what has happened to Sarah, similar in many respects, to Moira's ordeal.\n\n\"I really could not face talking about this and thought that perhaps one open letter would suffice.\"\n\nShe said her main concern was for Sarah's family and loved ones.\n\nShe wrote: \"They are totally devastated and bewildered and vulnerable. They cannot fully take in what has happened and the permanence of what has occurred.\n\n\"They have experienced nightmare on top of nightmare as events have unravelled and their beautiful missing daughter became another murder victim. And there seems no end to it.\"\n\nBea says she can understand the reaction and response from women nationwide to the shocking crime and believes Sarah's family may have been comforted by the thought that \"so many were grieving with them\".\n\nBut she continues: \"Now it has all escalated into a media frenzy more representative of individual anger than of shared grief.\n\n\"I am very concerned that events have developed to such an extent that those who matter most, Sarah and her family, are being totally swamped and further traumatised by what is going on around them, adding trauma to trauma.\n\n\"How can they cope at all? There is only so much that a head can absorb and a heart can cope with and they have so much more to find out in the weeks and months ahead as dreadful details of Sarah's death are revealed to them.\"\n\nA stone marks the spot in Queen's Park where Moira's body was discovered\n\nBea says the family need to be protected from media intrusion and then turns her thoughts towards Sarah's mother, whom she says will have a head full of questions about what happened to her daughter and what she went through.\n\nDrawing on her own experiences, she lists several, including: \"Did she know how very much we loved her?\"\n\nBea continues: \"There are no answers to these questions, there never will be, but she will keep on asking them, over and over torturing herself. I ask them still - not so often but after 13 years I ask them still.\n\n\"Sarah's mum needs time and space to ask them too, to run all sorts through her head before an avalanche of other information descends.\n\n\"Her family have lived with the joy of Sarah for 33 years and the loss of that joy will affect them for the rest of their lives. It will be a long time before they can even get past the trauma, to start processing the awfulness of it all and being able to grieve. There really are no words to describe that awfulness.\"\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was \"struck\" by this tribute left in Glasgow's Queen's Park to Moira Jones, who was murdered in 2008. She also tweeted a picture of a candle lit to remember \"Sarah, and all the others\"\n\nAs part of the nationwide events, ribbons and messages have been tied to the gates of Queen's Park including many which mention Moira, 40, by name.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to the sales executive on social media at the weekend and said she thought of Moira every time she walked through the park in the south side of the city.\n\nBea said she had been moved by the fresh messages of support for her \"darling girl\", who moved from London to Glasgow in 2003.\n\nThe campaigner has previously described how she cannot bear to say the name of the man who killed Moira.\n\nBea also called on the media to focus on Sarah Everard as opposed to Met police officer Wayne Couzens, who is accused of murdering and kidnapping the marketing executive.\n\nShe concludes her letter by pledging to continue to support those who have been bereaved by violence and urges the public never to forgot the pain they go through.\n\nShe wrote: \"We frequently read and hear of murder cases in the news but it is rare indeed for us to read of the plight of those left behind, whose lives that are changed forever by the violent death of a loved one.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

He has denied the allegations.\n\nShadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said there was an ongoing investigation relating to his resignation that the party took \"very seriously\".\n\nMr Hill, 57, had served as the MP for the town since 2017.\n\nLabour held Hartlepool at the 2019 General Election, when the Conservatives came second by fewer than 4,000 votes.\n\nThe by-election could be held on 6 May to coincide with local and mayoral elections in England, and will pose the first electoral test of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership since taking over from Jeremy Corbyn last year.\n\nThe constituency Labour Party said it wanted a candidate in place \"quickly\".\n\nIn September 2019, Mr Hill was suspended from the party following an accusation of sexual harassment.\n\nThat was later dropped, he had the whip restored and took the seat in the December election.\n\nSpeaking in October 2019, Mr Hill said he \"completely rejected\" the allegations and it had been a \"very difficult time\" for his family, friends and staff.\n\nHartlepool has long been a Labour stronghold but the Conservatives and Brexit Party made inroads in 2019\n\nThe upcoming by-election will be framed as the first litmus test of Sir Keir Starmer's Labour leadership.\n\nBut politics in the North East coastal town can be more labyrinthine than a simple popularity contest between Labour and Conservative.\n\nHartlepool gave the Brexit Party its first council leadership, when a group of Independent councillors switched allegiance in September 2019 only to revert to being independents four months later.\n\nIt famously elected its football club mascot H'Angus the Monkey as mayor in 2002 and re-elected the man in the costume, Stuart Drummond, twice more before the post was abolished.\n\nQuestions about how this by-election will play out provide intrigue.\n\nWho will claim the 10,000 votes cast for the Brexit Party at the 2019 General Election?\n\nHas the local Labour Party - so riven with in-fighting it lost control of Hartlepool Council before a vote was cast in 2019 - been able to restore order sufficiently to mount a robust defence of the seat?\n\nWill big regional announcements like the Teesside Freeport or Darlington's treasury campus send voters towards the Tories?\n\nHow will a rare all-out council election affect the poll, if it does take place on the same day?\n\nIt's going to be fascinating, but then politics in Hartlepool frequently is.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "A new approach to making jet fuel from food waste has the potential to massively reduce carbon emissions from flying, scientists say.\n\nCurrently, most of the food scraps that are used for energy around the world are converted into methane gas.\n\nBut researchers in the US have found a way of turning this waste into a type of paraffin that works in jet engines.\n\nThe authors of the new study say the fuel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 165% compared to fossil energy.\n\nThis figure comes from the reduction in carbon emitted from airplanes plus the emissions that are avoided when food waste is diverted from landfill.\n\nThe aviation industry worldwide is facing some difficult decisions about how to combine increased demand for flying with the need to rapidly cut emissions from the sector.\n\nIn the US, airlines currently use around 21 billion gallons of jet fuel every year, with demand expected to double by the middle of the century. At the same time, they have committed to cutting CO2 by 50%.\n\nWith the development of battery-powered airplanes for long haul flights a distant prospect at this point, much attention has focussed on replacing existing jet fuel with a sustainable alternative.\n\nIn fact the UK government has just announced a \u00a315m competition to encourage companies to develop jet fuel from household waste products.\n\nCurrent methods of making green jet fuel are based on a similar approach to making biodiesel for cars and heavy goods vehicles.\n\nIt normally requires the use of virgin vegetable oils as well as waste fats, oil and grease to make the synthetic fuel.\n\nAt present, it is more economical to convert these oils and wastes into diesel as opposed to jet fuel - which requires an extra step in the process, driving up costs.\n\nNow, researchers say that they have developed an alternative method able to turn food waste, animal manure and waste water into a competitive jet hydrocarbon.\n\nMuch of this material, termed wet-waste, is at present is turned into methane gas. However, the authors found a way of interrupting this process so it produced volatile fatty acids (VFA) instead of CH4.\n\nThe researchers were then able to use a form of catalytic conversion to upgrade the VFA to two different forms of sustainable paraffin.\n\nFood waste is a global problem and a major cause of global warming emissions\n\nWhen the two forms were combined they were able to blend 70% of the mixture with regular jet fuel, while still meeting the extremely strict quality criteria that Federal authorities impose on aircraft fuels.\n\n\"There's exciting jet fuels that rely on burning trash and dry waste but this actually works for those wastes that have high water content, which we normally dispose of in landfill,\" said Derek Vardon, a senior research engineer at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the lead author on the study.\n\n\"Being able to show that you can take these volatile fatty acids, and that there's a really elegant, simple way to turn it into jet fuel - that's where I see the broader applicability of this one, and folks can continue to develop and refine it.\"\n\nThe new fuel has a potentially significant impact on emissions as it not only limits the CO2 that comes from fossil sources used by the airlines, but it also gets rid of the methane that would bubble up from landfill if the waste food was just dumped.\n\nAnother major advantage is that this new fuel produces around 34% less soot than current standards. This is important because soot plays a key role in the formation of contrails from airplanes which adds a powerful warming effect to CO2 coming from the engines.\n\nEmissions from flying are set to rise rapidly over the next two decades\n\n\"That's where we see the most potential for this technology is that you're preventing methane emissions, and dramatically lowering the carbon footprint of jet fuel. And you just can't do that with fossil fuels without getting into things like offsets,\" said Derek Vardon.\n\nThe research team say they are planning to scale up the production of the new fuel and aim to have test flights with Southwest Airlines in 2023.\n\nMany environmental groups are sceptical about attempts to develop sustainable aviation fuels, believing that it amounts to green-washing. They argue that people should just fly less.\n\n\"Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet,\" Derek Vardon says.\n\n\"So we do want to definitely emphasise that reduction is the most important and most significant change you can make. But there's also pragmatism and need for aviation solutions now, so that's where we want to strike a balance as we need a basket of measures, to really start getting our carbon footprint down in a variety of sectors, including aviation.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).",

He added that it would also not be possible to \"shift the dial\" on climate change without co-operating with the country.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said there would also be \"difficult issues\" to manage, including over protecting UK industrial secrets and telecoms infrastructure.\n\nBut he warned: \"It wouldn't make sense, I don't think it would be feasible to go into some old, outdated Cold War mentality with China.\"\n\nPressed on whether the UK should toughen its stance on the country, as advocated by so-called China hawks, Mr Raab replied: \"China is here to stay.\"\n\nMr Raab also said more nuclear warheads could be required as part of the Integrated Review, as they represented the \"ultimate insurance policy\" against global threats.\n\nFor years Britain's place in the world was defined by its membership of the European Union and its relationship with the United States.\n\nIt was often seen as a bridge between the two.\n\nBut Brexit changed all that. So now the government is looking for Britain to play a new global role.\n\nThe big idea of the so-called Integrated Review of foreign policy is a new focus on the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe government wants to boost Britain's trade, security and diplomacy in a region that is seeing fast economic growth.\n\nBut it also wants to build new partnerships as Britain recalibrates its relationship with the biggest player in Asia, namely China.\n\nThe question is what this new \"Indo-Pacific tilt\" will actually mean in practice and whether it will come at a cost of not focusing enough on repairing relations with the EU.\n\nThe long-awaited integrated review of foreign and defence policy will also set out plans for a White House-style situation room built in the Cabinet Office.\n\nIt will also include plans for a new counter-terrorism operations centre, intended to improve the speed of response to terrorist incidents.\n\nSir Alex Younger, a former head of MI6, told Today the gap between western nations and China had closed in important ways during the coronavirus pandemic, and a new approach was now needed.\n\nWhile he said there was \"no sense declaring a new Cold War\", Sir Alex admitted both China and the Russian government presented \"generational\" threats to Britain.\n\nWhile the government says Nato remains the bedrock of defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, it wants to work alongside allies to \"shape a more open international order in which democracies flourish\".\n\nBBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the aim of the review would be to showcase offensive as well as defensive capabilities, suggesting high-tech investment in fields like artificial intelligence will help modernise the military, maintain Britain's power and bring economic growth at home.\n\nBut he said becoming a technology \"superpower\" and competing with the likes of China was no easy task.\n\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said there was a \"yawning chasm\" between the government's words and actions and said government policy had \"left our defences down in our own backyard\".\n\nThe publication of the review comes months after Boris Johnson announced a \u00a316.5bn increase in defence spending over the next four years.\n\nAt the time, he said the funding would allow for investment in an agency dedicated to artificial intelligence and a \"space command\" capable of launching the UK's first rocket by 2022, as well as a cyber corridor across the north of England which would include headquarters for the new National Cyber Force.\n\nBut MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee have warned the extra funding could be swallowed up by a \"black hole\" in department finances, with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facing a potential \u00a317bn shortfall in its current equipment programme.\n\nThe committee said a further \u00a320bn the military wanted to invest has not been included in the budget and the MPs also accused the MoD of making unrealistic claims about future efficiency savings.\n\nIts chair, Meg Hillier, said it was crucial that the extra money for defence was not eaten up by the \"constant debilitating\" budget overruns that \"have been eroding our national defence and security for years\".\n\nThe MoD said the increased funding would \"restore financial sustainability\".",

            "description": "Users of the betting company say they have lost thousands of pounds after the operation was suspended.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Queens Park Rangers said on Friday it had now removed Football Index sponsorship from its shirts.\n\nIt's been sleepless nights and cold sweats for customers of Football Index, the gambling company whose collapse into administration has left people facing huge losses.\n\n\"I feel embarrassed and cheated,\" Ben told the BBC. He's not alone. Social media and online chat threads are alight with anger and dismay at the rapid demise of one of the UK's fastest growing betting firms.\n\nIn the couple of weeks before Football Index called in administrators to run the business, Ben, aged 22, lost more than \u00a34,000 in seven days, \u00a31,400 of which disappeared in 24 hours. It's now possible he will lose all his \u00a36,500 deposit in the firm.\n\n\"I'm employed, I live at home, and I've not got many overheads. I'm only responsible for myself right now, but there are people out there with families who have been hit a lot worse.\"\n\nLike other people who spoke to the BBC - young, male and red-faced at losing so much money - Ben did not want to disclose his surname.\n\n\"The crash has affected me mentally,\" he said. \"Everyone affected by this wants to say how disappointed they are with the leadership of Football Index.\"\n\nThe Jersey-based company styled itself as a \"stock market of football\". Gamblers, which it called punters, bought and sold \"shares\" in professional footballers, earning dividend payments depending on the players' performance and rising - or falling - value.\n\nLaunched in 2015, it soon became a fixture of the sports betting sector and was a sponsor of Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest football teams, which have removed branding.\n\nNow, Football Index risks becoming the biggest failure in UK gambling history. Reports suggest punters stand to lose up to \u00a3100m. Law firm Leigh Day is investigating whether there are grounds to take legal action against the platform on behalf of affected punters.\n\nJack, 24, told the BBC: \"I have always been really into football. But I was never interested in traditional football betting. Football Index had a stock market element, which attracted me. It combined my interest in analysing the game.\"\n\nHe has already lost \u00a35,000, and fears his remaining \u00a32,500 locked up in the business will go. \"I earn a modest public sector wage, so \u00a37,500 goes a long way.\"\n\nHe says that, with hindsight, there were signs Football Index had been \"going downhill for a while\". But things turned really sour on 5 March.\n\nThe company cut dividend payouts on players, sparking a crash in their \"share\" value. There's also concern that Football Index had recently issued \"shares\" in new players, which encouraged people to \"invest\".\n\nWhat angers customers is that these were corporate policy changes, and nothing to do with footballers' performances. \"We all knew that if a footballer broke a leg or moved to China, that would affect the value,\" he said. \"This was different.\"\n\nAnother Football Index customer put it this way: \"If I'd put \u00a31,000 on the 3.15 at Ascot and it came last, that's my fault. I'll take the hit.\" But Football Index \"moved the goalposts in the middle of the game\", he believes.\n\n\"\u00a320,000 is a lot of money to lose. I have been putting money into Football Index since 2016, when I was 18. A year ago my portfolio was 100% up.\n\n\"The drop in value of my portfolio sets me back a lot. Most of it was savings. I've seen Football Index as my savings account.\n\n\"I will have to think about what to do without that substantial money and I have made cutbacks in my personal life. I've moved out of London and back into the family home. I used to be quite free with my spending but now I tell myself that I can't spend anything.\n\n\"I would have wanted to buy property with the money - put it down as a deposit.\n\n\"Mentally, football doesn't give me the same enjoyment. I put a lot of energy into my portfolio. After five years of putting energy into it, it's all been sucked out.\"\n\nJack says it was almost a relief when management called in administrators to try to salvage something from the business.\n\n\"For days (before the collapse) I'd been struggling with what to do - pull out what money was left, hang on for an upturn,\" he said. \"There's been talk of legal action. I've considered that. Now the decisions have been taken out of my hands. It's lifted a worry.\"\n\nSome critics argue Football Index was akin to a Ponzi scheme. \"To pay out dividends, it required more customers to deposit money. When that dried up, the problems started\", said Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling and a former gambling addict.\n\n\"Football Index is an unsustainable business model. They created a stock market out of assets they themselves created. The football players on the market had no underlying value,\" he said.\n\nJack thinks the Ponzi comparison is unfair. Gamblers knew what they were getting into - they just didn't expect Football Index to suddenly change its terms, he said.\n\n\"The concept is still brilliant. It was fun. If there was a change of management I'd be willing to give them a second chance - but I'll definitely reduce my (financial) stake,\" he said.\n\nJack, and Mr Zarb-Cousin, agree on one thing, though: the Gambling Commission (GC) has a lot of questions to answer.\n\n\"Football Index should never have been given a licence. Did the Gambling Commission really understand what they were approving? They should certainly have acted earlier,\" Mr Zarb-Cousin said.\n\nJames Grimes, an ex-gambler and founder of the The Big Step campaign group, said: \"It comes as little surprise to many of us harmed by gambling that another company has failed to protect its customers from immeasurable harm.\n\n\"The immediate financial impact on the people caught up in this failure is devastating, but the damage to mental health and affected others is too much to contemplate, especially when gambling-related harm incurs such a high suicide risk.\"\n\nThe GC declined to comment, instead referring the BBC to its statement last week and suspension of the company's gambling licence after Football Index called in administrators. This statement said the GC had concerns Football Index was not operating \"in accordance with a condition of its licence\".\n\nFootball Index also declined to comment. In a statement last week, the company's parent, BetIndex, said its \"goal\" was for Football Index to re-open for trading once a restructuring was completed. It also said remaining cash balances were being held in a \"segregated account\".\n\u2022 None What has happened to Football Index?",
