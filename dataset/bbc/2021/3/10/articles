            "section": "London",
            "content": "A serving Met police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the disappearance of Sarah Everard.\n\nMs Everard, 33, was last seen a week ago in Clapham, south London, on her way home from a friend's house.\n\nThe suspect, in his 40s, is an officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, the Met said.\n\nA woman, in her 30s, is also in custody after being arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\n\nThe Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found.\n\nHer cousin, Tom Everard, said the family want to \"focus on the facts as they emerge\".\n\n\"I want to encourage people to come forward with anything they might have, and to continue supporting the police investigation,\" the 36-year-old added.\n\n\"We have to believe Sarah will still be found and brought back safely.\"\n\nOfficers are currently searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford.\n\nThe arrested officer, who was initially held on suspicion of kidnap, is also being questioned about a separate allegation of indecent exposure.\n\nHe was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street, the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London.\n\nHe was off duty at the time of his arrest.\n\nSince last Wednesday, officers have visited more than 750 homes in the Clapham area and have received more than 120 phone calls from the public, the Met said.\n\nMarketing executive Ms Everard vanished on 3 March and was last captured on a doorbell camera walking alone along the A205 Poynders Road towards Tulse Hill at about 21:30 GMT.\n\nMs Everard's family previously said it was out of character for her to disappear.\n\nShe is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton - a journey which should have taken about 50 minutes.\n\nSpeaking after the arrest on Tuesday, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: \"The fact that the man who has been arrested is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.\"\n\nMs Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with Ms Everard and her friends and family.\n\nAfter the arrest the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\n\nThe IOPC said a mandatory referral was made in relation to the Met's actions after Ms Everard was reported missing.\n\nThis morning Mr Ephgrave described the arrest of a serving Met Police officer as both shocking and disturbing.\n\nThat officer has now been further arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nIt's unusual for such a senior officer to give a statement at this stage of an investigation and perhaps reflects the horror felt within the force - a profession where colleagues often describe themselves as family.\n\nWe have now learnt the arrested officer is in his 40s and works in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was to patrol diplomatic premises.\n\nUnderstandably, Sarah's disappearance has made some people in and around Clapham nervous for their own safety.\n\nSocial media users have said the arrest of a police officer has heightened anxiety.\n\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: \"All women and girls should be able to feel safe on the streets of London at all times.\n\n\"I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah's disappearance and the developments in the case.\"\n\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Human remains have been found in the search for missing Sarah Everard, Met Commissioner Cressida Dick has said.\n\nMs Everard, 33, was last seen on 3 March in Clapham, south London, on her way home from a friend's house.\n\nDetectives have not yet been able to confirm the identity of the remains, which were discovered in woodland near Ashford, Kent.\n\nIt comes after a serving Met Police officer was arrested on suspicion of Ms Everard's kidnap and murder.\n\nThe officer, who has not been named by police, was arrested in Kent and is also being questioned about a separate allegation of indecent exposure.\n\nMs Everard, a marketing executive, was last seen in doorbell video footage walking alone down a main road near Clapham at 21:30 GMT, with police saying it was unclear if she reached her home in Brixton.\n\nIn a televised statement, Dame Cressida confirmed officers searching an area near Ashford had \"found, very sadly, what appears to be human remains\".\n\nThe Met Police commissioner said specialist officers had updated Ms Everard's family on the investigation.\n\nDame Cressida continued: \"Sarah's disappearance in these awful and wicked circumstances is every family's worst nightmare.\n\n\"I know Londoners will want to know that it is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets.\n\n\"But I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared.\"\n\nDame Cressida said the arrest of a serving Met Police officer on suspicion of murder \"has sent waves of shock and anger through the public and through the whole of the Met\".\n\n\"I speak on behalf of all my colleagues in the Met when I say we are utterly appalled at this dreadful news,\" she added. \"Our job is to patrol the streets and to protect people.\"\n\nHundreds of officers have been drafted in to help with the investigation as searches continue in south London and Kent.\n\nThe arrested officer was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London.\n\nHe was off duty at the time of Ms Everard's disappearance.\n\nA woman in her 30s was also arrested in Kent on Tuesday evening on suspicion of assisting an offender.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with Ms Everard and her friends and family.\n\nThe former Durham University student, who is originally from York, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers.\n\nShe is also thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\n\nThe case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) because it involves a police officer.\n\nA spokesman said it had been decided that the Met Police would investigate any potential conduct issues linked to the kidnap and murder allegations itself.\n\nThe IOPC is currently assessing whether any further measures should be taken in relation to the actions of police after Ms Everard was reported missing.\n\nThe BBC's home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said that if it did turn out that a Met Police officer had been involved then there would be a \"very strong sense of betrayal from the very top of [the organisation] down to the rank and file\".\n\nHe said the force would also feel the people of London \"above all\" will have been betrayed \"because they feel a deep sense of pride that their job is to protect the people of London and now here is one of their own officers suspected of doing the exact opposite in the worst possible way\".\n\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Scotland",
            "content": "Up to four adults from two different households will be able to meet outdoors in Scotland from Friday of this week, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe current rules only allow outdoor meetings between two adults from two households.\n\nRestrictions on young people will also be eased, with four people aged between 12-17 able to meet even if they are all from different households.\n\nOutdoor non-contact group sports for adults will also restart on Friday.\n\nAnd people will be able to gather for communal worship from 26 March, so long as no more than 50 people are in attendance and physical distancing is maintained throughout.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the \"modest\" easing was the result of the progress the country was making in suppressing the virus.\n\nHowever, the overall requirement to stay at home will remain in place except for specific purposes - which from Friday will include limited, outdoor socialising and recreation.\n\nAnd the first minister said the strong grounds for hope must be balanced by caution.\n\nShe said: \"Because we have been in lockdown, it is easy to overlook the fact that the virus we are dealing with now is much more infectious than the one we were dealing with in the autumn.\n\n\"But we will be reminded of that very quickly if we try to do too much too soon.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said she will set out a firmer indicative timetable for re-opening the economy - including shops, hospitality, hairdressers, gyms and parts of the tourism industry - next week.\n\nShe also said she hoped to be in a position to relax the current travel restrictions in the weeks ahead - but insisted that it was not yet safe to do so.\n\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that new cases, the number of people being admitted to hospital and deaths were all \"still higher than we would want\".\n\nHowever she said there was a clear \"positive trend\" in figures, alongside \"excellent progress with the vaccination programme\".\n\nAlthough the number of vaccines being administered each day has fallen in recent weeks, the first minister said supplies would increase to \"allow for a very significant acceleration\" of the programme from mid-March.\n\nMs Sturgeon said that while the current prospects were \"very encouraging indeed\", it was \"essential\" to get the timing of easing lockdown right.\n\nShe said: \"Even though we are heading firmly in the right direction right now, we cannot afford to take our foot off the brake too soon.\n\n\"We still need to keep the virus under control if our hopes for a much more normal summer are not to suffer a setback.\"\n\nThe government had planned to move Scotland out of full lockdown and back into a regional levels system from late April.\n\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs that \"if the data allows us to relax more restrictions more quickly than we have previously indicated, we will not hesitate to do so\".\n\nShe also warned that everyone must continue to stick to the rules, with indoor meetings between different households still not possible and people being urged to stay as close to home as possible.\n\nMeetings will be possible in any outdoor space - including in private gardens - but people should only go into someone's else's home if it is essential to reach a back garden, or to use the toilet.\n\nAll of Scotland's school pupils are to return to the classroom from next week, with primary children to go back full-time and secondary students to have some in-class time before the Easter break.\n\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson asked the first minister whether the government would increase the actual amount of teaching time secondary pupils will get when back in school.\n\nShe said: \"Pupils and parents were promised a return to the classroom, but - from the information they are now being sent - for many this will amount to only a few hours at best.\"\n\nThe first minister replied that children returning to schools even part-time was a \"significant change\", saying: \"I will always look parents in the eye and explain the difficult challenges we are trying to balance.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the easing of rules around socialising outdoors was important for people's mental health and wellbeing.\n\nBut he said the government must strive to \"ensure this is our last lockdown\" by getting its testing and vaccination programmes right.\n\nMeanwhile, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asked if there could be an increase in virus cases in Glasgow after Rangers fans gathered to celebrate the football team winning the Scottish Premiership title.\n\nScottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie claimed the club \"did nothing\" to prevent the gathering.\n\nMs Sturgeon said any spike in infections would not become clear for several weeks.\n\nShe added: \"Make no mistake, having crowds of people risks spreading this virus - people who gather are putting their own health at risk, but also that of their loved ones and the wider community.\n\n\"That behaviour wasn't just irresponsible, it was deeply selfish\".\n\nRangers has insisted it urged its fans to follow the lockdown guidelines.",

            "content": "LGBT+ campaigners have urged the government to \"make good\" the prime minister's promise to ban \"conversion therapy\" in England and Wales.\n\nIt comes as three advisers quit the government's LGBT+ advisory panel amid concern it is being too slow in bringing in legislation.\n\nMinisters have promised to \"work at pace\" to end conversion therapy.\n\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had a \"blind spot\" on the issue that the PM had to \"address\".\n\nConversion therapy involves treatments ranging from psychotherapy to religious teaching and discussion.\n\nCampaigners want a \"meaningful\" law against the practice, which aims to change sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nAll forms of conversion therapy are already prohibited in Switzerland and parts of Australia and Boris Johnson pledged last summer to ban what he called an \"abhorrent\" practice in England and Wales.\n\nBut the government has not yet published the findings of a consultation on the issue which began in 2018.\n\nIn a debate in Parliament on Monday, equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said conversion therapy had \"no place in a civilised society\", but added that \"robust\" laws were already in place to deal with the most troubling examples, involving violence and sexual assault.\n\nAnd the government did not want to stop those who \"seek spiritual counselling as they explore their sexual orientation\", she said.\n\nBut LGBT+ groups and campaigners, including Stonewall, the LGBT Foundation and Trans Media Watch, say a ban on all forms of conversion therapy, not just the most distressing types, is needed.\n\nIn a letter to Ms Badenoch, they express \"deep concern\" over her comments, arguing they appeared to \"imply that you have been meeting with perpetrators of conversion therapy and those who want the practice to continue\".\n\nThe letter continues: \"This is very worrying and gives the impression that the government is more interested in appeasing the extreme fringes of religious people, despite the calls for a ban from senior religious leaders from across a wide range of faiths.\"\n\nTwo advisers quit the government's LGBT advisory panel on Wednesday, and a third resigned on Thursday.\n\nThere have been rumblings for a while about a growing unease amongst some panel members which are now playing out in a very public way.\n\nThe advisory group was first set up under Theresa May but hasn't met for some time - I'm told at least six months.\n\nAnd now we've heard claims that, even when it did meet, panellists didn't necessarily feel listened to.\n\nIf the group does appear increasingly defunct (and we'll have to see what happens) it may be seen, by some, as symbolic of a fading commitment to LGBT+ equality under this administration.\n\nMinisters would reject that and, during a debate on Monday, Kemi Badenoch said the government has a \"proud record\" of championing equal opportunity.\n\nBut it was her response overall that seems to have sparked these resignations.\n\nAmong concerns was her refusal to commit to a legislative \"ban\" of so-called conversion therapy, promising instead only to \"end\" the practice.\n\nThe equalities minister described the legal landscape as \"complex\". But it's an awkward one for Boris Johnson who did, last summer, use the word \"ban\" during a TV interview.\n\nJayne Ozanne, who resigned first, accused ministers of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT+ people.\n\nShe said there had been \"a lack of engagement\", telling ITV News that both Ms Badenoch and minister for women and equalities Liz Truss were known among the LGBT+ community as \"the ministers for inequality\".\n\nAnother of those who quit the panel, James Morton, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"For the past 12 months I've been increasingly concerned about the direction of travel on trans rights.\"\n\nHe added that it felt \"really scary\" being a trans person \"in the UK at the moment\".\n\nAnd Ellen Murray said she had resigned \"due to the government's persistent and worsening hostility towards our community\".\n\n\"From conversion therapy to trans healthcare, to the shameful treatment of LGBT refugees, the government has acted in appalling faith,\" she added.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government \"has a blind\" spot in the issue.\n\n\"The PM needs to address what is obviously a problem in his government and a pattern of behaviour he needs to address,\" he said at his party's local election campaign launch.\n\nAsked if he would ban conversion therapy if he were prime minister, Sir Keir said: \"yes, absolutely.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government \"bows to nobody in terms of our pushing for LBTQ issues, LGBT rights and also rights of minorities\".\n\nOn Wednesday, a government spokesman said: \"We have repeatedly made clear that we will take action to end conversion therapy and we are working to bring forward plans to do so shortly.\"\n\nThe LGBT Advisory Council was set up in 2019, with the term of current panel members set to end on 31 March.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Heathrow Airport regularly sees queues of three hours and sometimes six hours at border control, according to Emma Gilthorpe, its chief operating officer.\n\nEarlier this month, passengers complained of waiting up to seven hours, which one said was \"inhumane\".\n\nBut Border Force said many passengers were arriving without having bought mandatory Covid testing packages.\n\nThe enforcement body added that people should only be travelling for limited reasons.\n\nSeparately, hundreds of Heathrow passport control are set to take industrial action.\n\nUnions representing Border Force officials said the delays were partly caused by Covid restrictions requiring immigration officials to work in a bubble of 10.\n\nThey said this prevented more staff being deployed if the border was particularly busy.\n\nBut Nick Jariwalla, director of Border Force at Heathrow, said: \"We are in a global health pandemic - it is illegal to go on holiday and people should only be travelling for very limited reasons.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a large number of passengers are continuing to arrive without having purchased their mandatory testing packages for the second and eighth days of quarantine in the UK.\n\n\"This causes delays as passengers may receive a fine or be subject to other enforcement action.\"\n\nMr Jariwalla said all arriving passengers had to purchase the testing package before leaving the airport.\n\n\"We make absolutely no apologies for this,\" he added. \"Every essential check stops the spread of coronavirus in the UK.\n\n\"These people should not have been allowed to travel without their testing packages and we are following up with regulators and carriers to ensure the law is enforced.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Ms Gilthorpe said that pre-Covid, the queues for EU arrivals were supposed to be 25 minutes, and 45 minutes for non-EU arrivals.\n\nWhile she said she expected the length of waiting to go up during the pandemic, Ms Gilthorpe said the levels the airport was currently seeing were \"unacceptable\".\n\nWhile Ms Gilthorpe said the measures in place for quarantine hotels were running relatively smoothly, with a small number of passengers, she said the same could not be said for the border.\n\n\"We are seeing significant pressure on the border and we are seeing very long queues, and that is a worry,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Ms Gilthorpe said she knew additional resources had been introduced, the issues were caused by \"the level of complexity of the processes and the way resource is being deployed\".\n\nInternational arrivals must now provide proof of a negative Covid test taken 72 hours before departure to England and a passenger locator form which contains details of either a purchased hotel quarantine stay, or two test kits for at home quarantine.\n\nShe told the committee: \"It is deeply frustrating as the operator of the airport when you have a queue full of people and you only have two desks open.\n\n\"It is rare to see all the desks manned and we have to find our way to how we make that happen so we can get that flow.\"\n\nHeathrow's self-service e-gates at passport control are currently closed.\n\nMs Gilthorpe said she hoped that by the summer, the gates would also be able to scan passenger locator forms and pre-departure testing results, but that had not yet been integrated into the system.\n\nThe Heathrow executive also warned that if the long queues continued after international travel is permitted. it could risk the country's economic resurgence.\n\n\"Heathrow is Britain's hub airport, it is the front door. We have to get our economy moving and we have to make sure we are capable of receiving people,\" she said.\n\n\"If you have a poor experience at the border, there's a risk you won't come back again. That traffic will go to Charles De Gaulle [airport in Paris], it will go to Frankfurt and we will miss out on that economic resurgence,\" she said.\n\nThe queue delays come as staff in the PCS union served notice of industrial action over rosters they describe as \"unworkable\".\n\nThis will involve a month of action short of a strike by hundreds of staff, including working to rule and an overtime ban.\n\nThe roster changes include ending the ability of staff to swap and request certain shifts, the union said.\n\nIn February, staff voted for strike action over the changes, the union said.",

            "content": "A \"toxic culture\" of bullying and harassment at Sellafield could let serious safety concerns go unreported, whistleblowers have told the BBC.\n\nIn a leaked letter, the nuclear site's group for ethnic minority staff described \"shocking stories\" of racial abuse.\n\nOther workers said sexist and homophobic bullying had become routine.\n\nSellafield said it was committed to eradicating unacceptable behaviour from the workplace.\n\n\"When I started working there, it quickly became apparent there was rampant bullying in the organisation,\" said Alison McDermott, a senior consultant hired in 2017 to work on Sellafield's equality strategy.\n\nShe said staff interviews and focus groups revealed serious allegations of sexual harassment at the sprawling site on the Cumbrian coast.\n\n\"Young women were saying they were in tears after work because of the way they were sexually harassed,\" she said.\n\nOne interviewee said she was asked in graphic terms by a senior manager if she performed sexual favours to win a recent promotion, according to McDermott.\n\nIn one internal email seen by the BBC, a senior HR manager at the site described how an autistic employee had been called a \"mong\" by her own team leader.\n\n\"This is a nuclear site, where many employees are demoralised, bullied and scared to speak out,\" Ms McDermott said.\n\n\"You've got toxic materials and a toxic culture, if you put those two together then you've got a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nMs McDermott's contract with Sellafield was terminated in October 2018, days after she submitted an internal report critical of the human resources department.\n\nShe is now taking her case to an employment tribunal alleging she was dismissed for whistleblowing. The nuclear site is contesting her allegations.\n\nSellafield, the largest nuclear site in Western Europe, reprocesses spent nuclear fuel, splitting it into plutonium, uranium and waste.\n\nMore than 140 tonnes of plutonium are stored in giant hangers, the biggest civil stockpile of the metal in the world.\n\nStaff are tasked with decontaminating and dismantling the vast site which has been producing nuclear material since the 1950s.\n\nSellafield is ultimately owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a non-departmental government body.\n\nIt employs more than 10,000 staff directly with thousands more working indirectly through contractors.\n\nThe BBC has also seen a letter sent in September 2020 by Sellafield's network of ethnic minority staff to the firm's board, cataloguing a series of 27 racist incidents.\n\nOne employee said they were walking through the site when a driver of a passing car shouted \"racist taunts\" before speeding off.\n\n\"I reported it but after a cursory investigation I was told nothing could be done to find and deal with the culprit,\" the staff member said.\n\nSellafield is guarded by the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, a specialist police unit\n\nThe letter contains multiple examples of offensive racial slurs being used openly on the site.\n\nOne worker said his instructor at a training course told the class the main threat to the site was \"bearded men in flip-flops\".\n\n\"He then singled me out and mockingly looked under the table at my shoes to the delight of the class,\" the worker wrote.\n\n\"I happen to be a bearded Muslim man. [The instructor] went on to say: 'They [Muslims] come over on boats, we feed them, we clothe them, we house them and all they want to do is blow us up.' None of my colleagues intervened or supported me.\"\n\nThe letter calls on the Sellafield board to accept the organisation has a problem with racism and commit to better education and training.\n\n\"We fear that if we complain, we could be branded a troublemaker and mark ourselves out to be got rid of. It is exhausting that we must be wary of those who we spend most of our waking hours with,\" the letter said.\n\nKarl Connor, a senior manager at Sellafield for more than 13 years, resigned in January after suffering a breakdown he said was caused, in part, by bullying.\n\n\"I think there's a massive problem with bullying at Sellafield and I think there always will be as long as the company isn't prepared to do anything about it,\" he said.\n\nHe said there were some \"fantastic people\" working on the site but the working culture could be difficult to deal with.\n\n\"If you want to earn a good wage and live in that part of the world, then you have to work at Sellafield or in one of the supply chain companies,\" he said.\n\n\"The best thing for most people is not to rock the boat, to keep their heads down and just put up with it.\"\n\nMr Connor is now in the process of bringing a disability discrimination case against the company.\n\nA work environment where staff are treated with dignity and respect is an \"essential trait of a healthy nuclear safety culture\", according to the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organisation formed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster - of which Sellafield is a member.\n\nAn internal staff survey commissioned by the firm in 2018 and seen by the BBC showed 54% of the employees who filled in the poll agreed they \"could speak out about doing the right thing without fear of reprisals\", a fall of 11 percentage points since the previous survey in 2016.\n\nSellafield management said staff surveys \"brought focus\" to concerns about bullying and harassment at the site.\n\n\"We did not ignore this, or seek to cover it up,\" said a spokesperson. \"We confronted the issue, proactively shared information with employees, and developed a company-wide improvement programme. This work is continuing.\"\n\nThe BBC has also spoken to a number of former and current members of staff who had concerns about safety at the site.\n\nIn one case a senior member of the underwater diving unit claimed he was bullied and sidelined after highlighting staffing levels he felt were unsafe. He said after he retired Sellafield did increase the number of people on the team.\n\nIn an incident from December 2017, a worker was exposed to plutonium after a bag of nuclear waste was opened in a workshop used to repair contaminated machinery.\n\nAn internal safety report seen by the BBC blamed a \"deficiency in leadership standards\" for the accident, a near repeat of a similar case in 2015 in which no-one was hurt.\n\nThe report said an alarm meant to measure radioactive contamination levels in the air was triggered, but it had become \"custom and practice\" to consider the alerts a nuisance by staff.\n\nThe BBC has seen redacted emails released under the freedom of information act, apparently between people involved in the subsequent investigation. A number refer to claims of a cover up and allegations of intimidating and threatening behaviour.\n\n\"It was a serious incident and not to be taken lightly,\" said one serving Sellafield employee who is currently responsible for nuclear safety.\n\n\"I've seen a steady deterioration in standards in my career. There are things that are not right but if you complain about it, nothing ever happens.\"\n\nThe safety report said new measures were put in place to prevent a similar accident in the future, with staff reminded of the checks they need to make in 'radiologically controlled areas'.\n\nA Sellafield spokesperson said: \"There is no place for bullying and harassment at Sellafield. We do not tolerate it and where we find it, we take action.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the company was working to improve its processes so employees can have confidence that when issues are raised, they are dealt with.\n\n\"We closely monitor our progress, including seeking the views of our workforce through working groups and surveys,\" he said.\n\n\"We accept we have more work to do in this area, but we remain as committed as ever to eradicating unacceptable behaviour from our workplace.\"",

Two officers were eventually fired.\n\nBreonna's death was one of several in recent years which contributed to global protests against racism and police brutality in 2020.\n\nDuring the raid, Kenneth Walker fired at the officers who he said he believed were attackers breaking into the couple's home.\n\nPolice claim they made it clear who they were before knocking the front door down.\n\nThey reportedly knocked on the door to announce their presence before breaking it down with a battering ram.\n\nBreonna's boyfriend said he then fired out of self-defence. Three officers returned fire with 32 shots - six of which hit and killed her.\n\nHer name became part of a global Black Lives Matter protest as people demanded a thorough investigation into her death.\n\nDetectives Myles Cosgrove and Joshua Jaynes were recently fired from Louisville Police over their involvement, with authorities finding Cosgrove didn't follow procedures with use of force, and failed to use a body camera in the search.\n\nCampaigners are still demanding tougher action from the police.\n\nKenneth Walker was cleared of attempted murder two months after Breonna's death, but prosecutors were able to bring the charges back if new evidence came up.\n\nHowever now a judge has permanently closed the case against him, meaning he can't ever be charged again over it.\n\nThe officer who was shot, Sgt Jonathan Mattingly, recovered from the leg wound and still works at the Louisville police department.\n\n\"After the worst year of [Walker's] life, prosecutors have finally acknowledged that he did nothing wrong and acted in self-defence,\" Kenneth's lawyer Steve Romines told CBS News.\n\n\"He looks forward to continuing the fight to hold the real wrongdoers accountable for the harm that they've caused.\n\n\"Both he, individually, and our community, as a whole, cannot begin the process of healing until that happens.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

            "content": "Any \"stay-local\" policy introduced as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on what part of Wales people live in, the health minister said.\n\nVaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas.\n\n\"If we do go to stay local, it will be slightly different depending on where you live,\" he told a press briefing.\n\nHe suggested there could be a \"few weeks\" of stay-local guidance.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford is due to review Covid restrictions on Friday and has previously suggested there could be some easing of the stay-at-home instruction.\n\nSpeaking at the coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething told journalists: \"If, like me, you're fortunate enough to live in Penarth, then a few miles from Penarth you can do lots of things.\n\nStay local rules were brought in to after stay home legislation ended last summer\n\n\"If I lived in the middle of Powys or Anglesey, within a few miles I might not be able to do them, so we do recognise that if we go to stay local, it will be slightly different depending on where you live.\"\n\nHe added: \"Any guidance around that will recognise that.\"\n\nMr Gething said after a \"few weeks\" the Welsh Government could be in a position to go beyond stay local.\n\nMinisters have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Mr Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place.\n\nLast year, a stay-local rule was in place as the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home.\n\nThis led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members.\n\nBoth the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru welcomed an indication any \"stay local\" message could be differ across Wales.\n\nFor the Conservatives, Russell George said it was difficult to follow in rural areas, adding: \"I can't follow the same kind of measurements here in rural Powys as Vaughan Gething can in Penarth.\"\n\nPlaid's Rhun ap Iorwerth agreed, saying: \"Five miles in Cardiff means something very different in Anglesey.\"\n\nCovid testing will be expanded to anyone identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for the virus, Mr Gething also announced.\n\nCurrently contacts are only tested if they develop symptoms, but they will now be told to test on the first and eighth days of self-isolation.\n\nHe said: \"This will help us to identify more people with coronavirus and their close contacts who would otherwise be unknown to TTP [Track, Trace and Protect], helping to break chains of transmission and to stop the virus spreading\".\n\nHowever, he said it was not an alternative to self-isolating, adding: \"If you've been identified as a close contact, it's really important you complete the 10 days of isolation and do the two tests.\"\n\nHe said the Welsh Government would be putting an extra \u00a360m into contact tracing, as announced at last week's budget.\n\nMr Gething said all people \"experiencing homelessness\" would be included in the priority group six for Covid vaccinations.\n\n\"This includes people who are sleeping rough, people in emergency accommodation and people who were recently homeless but are now in supported accommodation,\" he told the briefing.\n\n\"Many people in this group will be living with underlying health conditions, which put them at risk of coronavirus.\n\n\"It's important they are offered vaccinations.\"\n\nLocal testing will be taking place in areas which have had high rates of community transmission, Mr Gething announced.\n\nHe said: \"Community testing to find more cases in people without symptoms is being rolled out in parts of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf - areas, which have historically had high rates of community transmission.\"\n\nThe minister also urged people to take up their vaccinations.\n\nHe said he was looking forward to having the vaccine \"in the coming days\".",

Experts said she was most likely still alive at the time.\n\n\"There you go. Amazing, absolutely amazing,\" he said, according to vision from the constable's body-worn camera which was tendered to a court.\n\n\"All I wanted was to go home and have some sushi,\" he added, before using expletives to blame the officers for ruining his Porsche sports car.\n\nHe fled the scene on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway shortly after.\n\nThe lorry driver, Mohinder Singh Bajwa, has pleaded guilty to four charges of culpable driving causing death and will face another court hearing this week.\n\nPusey, a mortgage broker, was arrested at his home after the crash. He was initially charged with speeding, drug possession and reckless conduct offences.\n\nHowever, police discovered Pusey's video and that he had shared it among friends.\n\nHis comments in the footage sparked public outrage, with Victoria's police minister condemning them as \"completely sickening\".\n\nLocal media reported that the offence of outraging public decency was rarely prosecuted in Australia.\n\nProsecutors in the case have referred to the 2007 case of Anthony Anderson in England, who was jailed for three years for urinating on a woman as she lay dying.\n\nThere is no maximum penalty for the charge in Australian law.\n\nPusey is due to face court again on 31 March.",

            "section": "Asia",
            "content": "Myanmar coup: 'We were told to shoot protesters', say police who fled\n\nPolice officers from Myanmar have told the BBC they fled across the border into India after refusing to carry out the orders of the military which seized power in a coup last month. In some of the first such interviews, more than a dozen defectors told us they escaped, fearing they'd be forced to kill or harm civilians.\n\n\"I was given orders to shoot at protesters. I told them I can't.\"\n\nFor nine years Naing - whose name we have changed for his safety - served as a policeman in Myanmar, also known as Burma.\n\nNow, the 27-year-old is in hiding in the north-east Indian state of Mizoram.\n\nI met him, and a group of policemen and women in their twenties, who say they ran away from their jobs back home, after refusing to carry out orders. \"I was afraid that I would be forced to kill or harm innocent people who are protesting against the military,\" one officer said.\n\n\"We feel that it was wrong for the military to overthrow an elected government.\"\n\nEver since the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power on 1 February, thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets.\n\nSecurity forces have been accused of killing more than 50 people.\n\nNaing, who is a low-ranking officer from a town in the west of the country, says protests in his area began to escalate at the end of February.\n\nHe says he ran, after refusing twice to fire at demonstrators.\n\n\"I told my boss I couldn't do that, and that I was going to side with the people.\n\n\"The military is edgy. They are becoming more and more brutal.\"\n\nAs we speak, Naing pulls out his phone to show me photos of the family he left behind - a wife, and two daughters aged just five and six months.\n\n\"I am worried that it may not be possible to meet them again,\" he told me.\n\nI met him and the rest of the group in an undisclosed location, overlooking the hills and valleys of the mountainous state of Mizoram, their home country of Myanmar less than 10 miles (16km) away from where we were chatting.\n\nThe officers we spoke to are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside the country.\n\nThey say they're part of a growing number of officials who are joining the pro-democracy, civil disobedience movement (CDM) in the country.\n\nThe BBC was unable to independently verify any of the claims made by the police who spoke to us.\n\nThe UN, the US and a host of other countries have condemned the killing of civilians in the crackdown against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar, and called on the authorities to exercise restraint. The military has dismissed criticism of its actions and said it is ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after it seized power.\n\nAccording to local officials, more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup.\n\nHtut - not his real name - recalls the night the military junta overthrew the government, after the internet was shut down and an army post was erected close to his station.\n\n\"A few hours later we learned the military had staged a coup.\"\n\nHtut, who is 22, says he and other police were paired with members of the military as they patrolled the streets. Protesters who were peacefully banging utensils in support of the pro-democracy movement were threatened with arrest.\n\nHtut, who is from a large city in Myanmar, says he too was asked to fire at protesters, a demand he refused.\n\n\"The military officer in charge ordered us to shoot people coming out in groups of more than five. I know that people were beaten up. I had sleepless nights.\n\n\"When I saw innocent people bleeding, my conscience wouldn't permit me to take part in such evil acts.\"\n\nHtut says he was the only one from his police station to flee, making the journey by motorbike. He says he was terrified as he passed from village to village to reach the border with India.\n\nThose we spoke to crossed into India over the Tiau river, which we visited. The 250-mile stretch of river forms part of the boundary between India and Myanmar.\n\nGroups we've spoken to say they expect more police to make this journey to India in the coming days.\n\nGrace, whose name we have changed, is one of two female police officers we met who has defected.\n\nShe said she saw the military use sticks and rubber bullets to round up protesters, and on one occasion tear gas being fired into a group which included children.\n\n\"They wanted us to disperse the crowds, and arrest our friends, but we couldn't do it,\" she said.\n\n\"We love the police, but now the system has changed, we can't continue our job.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old says she also wrestled with leaving her family back home, in particular her mother who has a serious heart condition.\n\n\"My parents are old, and they're also afraid. But we young people have no choice but to flee and leave them behind.\"\n\nAuthorities in Myanmar have asked India to return any defectors, to \"uphold friendly relations\".\n\nMizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga said those who have arrived should be given temporary shelter, while the national government decides what to do next.\n\nLocal groups have told us they expect many more defectors to make the journey to India in the coming days.\n\nIt's just not police officers who have fled. We met a shopkeeper who escaped to Mizoram, after authorities in Myanmar issued him with a warrant for rallying supporters online to join the pro-democracy movement.\n\n\"I'm not running away selfishly,\" he said, explaining why he risked it all to leave.\n\n\"Everyone inside the country is worried.\n\n\"I'm here for safety, and will continue to do what I can to support the movement, from this side.\"",

            "section": "Wales",
            "content": "Stalking protection orders: Police 'not using' new powers to protect victims\n\nNew powers to protect stalking victims are not being used by police, a BBC Wales investigation has found.\n\nIn January 2020, stalking protection orders were introduced to make it easier for victims to get support.\n\nBut since then only two full orders have been granted in Wales despite 3,000 stalking offences being reported to police.\n\nAll four Welsh police forces have been asked to comment on the findings by Eye on Wales.\n\nThe data also shows all four forces in Wales have made an application for an order to the courts, or currently have a application pending on behalf of victims.\n\nOnly one by Dyfed-Powys Police was granted, with an interim order given to North Wales Police, which later became a full order.\n\nThere are calls for better education and training so officers can recognise when action is needed to apply for an order.\n\nDet Ch Insp Richard Yelland, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said there were other options aside from protection orders.\n\n\"There are so many tools in our toolbox now thankfully with other legislation,\" he said.\n\n\"In those cases where it's appropriate, we will seek to use a protection order.\"\n\nFormer Miss Wales Sarah Manchipp was stalked for eight months. The perpetrator was caught and has now been jailed.\n\nShe told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme it was difficult to talk about what had happened but she wanted to raise awareness.\n\n\"It still affects me, but I want to talk about it and by talking about it I hope it gives confidence to other victims to go to the police.\n\n\"To begin with I received Facebook messages from this person saying he was going to rape me and kill me, but I have to say the police were great.\n\n\"Officers really took me seriously, but I am disappointed to hear they haven't been using these additional powers - more women need to come forward and talk about their experiences.\"\n\nBethan - not her real name to protect her identity - is based in Wales and shared her experience of being stalked and reporting it to the police.\n\n\"I'd wake up and have 100 missed calls in an hour, floods of text messages. It was persistent,\" she said.\n\n\"He'd also be outside and could tell me what I was wearing and who I was with.\"\n\nBethan said the long-lasting effects of the stalker's behaviour were devastating.\n\n\"I've got complex PTSD because of this; it made me very ill. I'm constantly on edge all the time.\"\n\nIt took Bethan a long time to recognise she was being stalked. However, once she recognised the behaviours, she reported it to the police several times.\n\n\"It was termed 'harassment' when I reported it, but nothing was done so I stopped reporting it,\" she said.\n\nThis was before stalking protection orders were introduced and Bethan feels they could have made a difference in her situation.\n\n\"If they were about for me back then, something would have been done - it would have been taken more seriously,\" she said.\n\n\"People should speak out about it now there's these new laws and more support. They're more likely to be believed.\"\n\nPolice now have extra powers with stalking protection orders\n\nStalking protection orders were introduced in January 2020 to police forces in Wales and England.\n\nThey are civil orders which aim to protect victims, and it is a criminal offence to breach the terms of an order.\n\nPolice apply to magistrates for an order, which usually remains in place for two years. The idea is that it can be used quickly and an interim order provides immediate protection while a decision is being made.\n\nWhen issued, they can include banning an offender contacting a person through social media, through a third party or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace.\n\nThere are also solution-based requirements, which aim to tackle the obsessive behaviour traits in the perpetrator. This can include mental health programmes, drug and alcohol support or counselling.\n\nCriminologist Professor Jane Monckton Smith, of the University of Gloucestershire, has been working with Dyfed-Powys Police to train officers to spot the signs of stalking.\n\n\"It seems to be a postcode lottery to how these protection orders are used, but I don't think many of the forces are using them routinely,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not necessarily a very simple process but the more police forces use them, the easier that process will be become.\"\n\nThe Suzy Lamplugh Trust is the UK's leading personal safety charity, which also manages the National Stalking Helpline.\n\nChief executive Suky Bhaker said: \"Overall, the introduction of stalking protection orders is proving to be a positive and useful tool for victims of stalking.\n\n\"However, there have been a number of cases where clients have not been adequately supported.\n\n\"We know that training varies in the police across Wales and England in stalking and what tools are available to help those victims varies as a result.\"\n\nKaty Bourne, Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is also a victim of stalking\n\nKaty Bourne, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is the lead for stalking in Wales and England.\n\nShe is also a victim of stalking and has urged other forces to use the orders to protect victims.\n\n\"We've issued about 30 stalking protection orders and we've got several others in the pipeline,\" she said.\n\n\"It says to the victim, 'we take you seriously', and that in itself is such a relief that the police are listening to you and believe you.\"\n\nA Gwent Police spokesperson said: \"Gwent Police employs a range of tactics to tackle this serious offence.\n\n\"This includes education and awareness training for our frontline staff, which has resulted in the successful prosecution of suspects responsible for stalking.\n\n\"We've also assisted the courts by providing support to survivors of this crime who are protected by restraining orders.\n\n\"Gwent Police will not tolerate this form of behaviour. We take all allegations of stalking seriously and our officers will investigate them thoroughly.\"\n\nFor details of organisations that provide help and support, visit bbc.co.uk/actionline\n\nListen to Eye On Wales on BBC Radio Wales on Wednesday 10 March at 18:30 or on BBC Sounds",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut air passenger duty on domestic flights in a bid to boost travel connections across the UK.\n\nA consultation will examine options including creating a new lower domestic rate or exempting return flights.\n\nThe move is likely to be welcomed by struggling airline operators hit by Covid, but worry environmental groups.\n\nThe PM has also committed \u00a320m for rail and road links and a review of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nMr Johnson has pledged new funding to upgrade road, rail and sea connections across the UK in an effort to reduce delays and bottlenecks and stimulate economic growth.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said a lack of a UK-wide transport strategy had led to \"inadequate connections\" between the four UK nations.\n\n\"For far too long, we have tended to carve up the country through a devolve and forget approach,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Johnson has championed the idea of connecting Northern Ireland with the British mainland via a bridge, despite scepticism from the Northern Irish and Scottish governments.\n\nTwo routes, between Portpatrick and Larne and Campbeltown and the Antrim coast, have been proposed.\n\nAnnouncing the findings of an interim report into transport connectivity by Sir Peter Hendy, the PM confirmed a separate feasibility study into the idea.\n\nTwo engineering professors will assess an outline cost and timescale and the associated works needed.\n\nArchitect Prof Alan Dunlop, who has long backed the idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland and Scotland, said he was confident the project was feasible.\n\n\"There are geological and infrastructural challenges, I don't deny that,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"But I'm absolutely convinced - and I've been looking at this now, researching it quite solidly, for three years - that the UK has both the engineering and architectural talent.\"\n\nKey arteries earmarked for investment include rail routes between the North coast of Wales and England, enhancements to the West Coast Mainline and the dualling of much of the A75 in south-west Scotland.\n\nCritics say billions of funding is needed to make up for a decade of under-investment in regional transport links in the north of England and that cash has been swallowed up by the multi-billion pound HS2 high-speed rail link.\n\nMr Johnson said Sir Peter's review, which is due to issue its final report in the summer, \"gives us the tools we need to deliver on our ambitions for a UK-wide transport network\".\n\n\"I also want to cut passenger duty on domestic flights so we can support connectivity across the country,\" he said.\n\nIn his Telegraph article, he added: \"It seems wrong that someone flying from Belfast to London and back pays more UK tax than someone flying from Dublin to London and back.\"\n\nThe environmental case over air passenger duty (APD) is not clear-cut.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the government shouldn't be cutting any taxes on polluting activities, especially because it's hosting a vital UN climate summit in November and it's trying to set an example.\n\nBut ministers are promising to balance out any cut in APD for domestic flights with a linked increase in APD on foreign flights.\n\nIf ministers make the APD switch, it will iron out what many people consider a tax anomaly.\n\nAt the moment, if you take a return flight from one UK airport to another, you pay the APD on both legs. If you fly abroad you pay APD on just one leg.\n\nSo you pay more tax flying from London to Belfast than from London to Dublin.\n\nThe government believes that's unfair and creates a bias against travel within the UK. Either way, environmentalists argue that aviation is still under-taxed.\n\nAirlines have been lobbying for a reduction in air passenger duty, whose standard rate for UK flights will rise to \u00a326 per customer per flight next month, long before the Covid-19 pandemic brought the industry to its knees.\n\nBut environmental groups say reducing the cost of flying will make it difficult, if not impossible, for the UK to meet its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as aviation is the single largest source of emissions.\n\nThe review will also look at the case for increasing the number of international distance bands. Currently, duty is charged on each passenger at the rate for the place where their journey ends.\n\nSince 2015, there have only been two bands, one covering flights of up to 2,000 miles and the other those in excess of that.\n\nFurther plans to decarbonise aviation will also be examined, including mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuels across the industry.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Labour has accused Boris Johnson of lying to MPs after he wrongly claimed Sir Keir Starmer had voted against a pay rise for NHS workers in England.\n\nThe party is calling on the PM to \"correct the record\" after he said Labour had voted against a 2.1% rise.\n\nThe 2.1% proposal - which has since been scrapped in favour of 1% - was approved without a vote in 2020.\n\nDowning Street said the mistake had been clarified and there was no need for the PM to apologise.\n\nDuring exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"Two years ago he made a promise to the NHS - here in black and white, his document - it commits to a minimum pay rise of 2.1%. It's being budgeted for and now it's being taken away.\n\n\"He shakes his head - his MPs voted for it. So why, after everything the NHS has done for us, is he now breaking promise after promise?\"\n\nMr Johnson replied: \"He voted against the document in question to crown the absurdity of his point.\"\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to \"get the prime minister to return to the House and correct the record\".\n\nMr Ashworth said: \"The prime minister has twice, from that dispatch box, said that the Labour opposition voted against the NHS Funding Bill and the 2.1% increase for NHS staff. This is not the case.\"\n\nSir Lindsay said Mr Ashworth's intervention was not something he would rule on but added \"it is certainly a point of clarification - that part has been achieved\".\n\nWriting on Twitter later, Mr Ashworth said that Mr Johnson had \"lied at PMQs\" and repeated Labour's demand for a vote in Parliament on the 1% offer.\n\nHe has written to the PM to ask him to \"correct the record\", telling him: \"At all times in the debate, Labour attempted to secure a greater financial settlement for the NHS in order to improve patient care.\"\n\nLabour says the proposed 1% rise amounts to a pay cut, when inflation has been taken into account.\n\nMr Johnson says it is all the country can afford at the present time, and NHS workers are set for a rise amid a public sector pay freeze, to reflect the \"massive debt\" owed to them by the nation.\n\nThe PM says he will make a final decision on pay when an independent review reports back in May.\n\nBoris Johnson told MPs Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS, after the Labour leader referred to it.\n\nThat is not correct - there were no votes on the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament.\n\nSir Keir had referred to the plan, saying that it committed the government to a 2.1% pay rise for the NHS.\n\nThe government has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens told a committee of MPs that the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise.\n\nBut he also said \"things have changed\" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body.\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton was asked more than 20 questions about the row at briefing for Westminster journalists.\n\nShe indicated that he would neither apologise nor correct the record.\n\n\"The key thing is that this was dealt with swiftly and the Speaker - who has enormous respect and authority in Parliament - regards it as a point of clarification and it has now been dealt with,\" she told reporters.\n\nAsked if Mr Johnson had a problem with facts, Ms Stratton said: \"No, he doesn't. The Speaker addressed this as a point of clarification and it has been dealt with today.\"\n\nThe ministerial code states that it is of \"paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity\".\n\nMs Stratton said Mr Johnson \"absolutely agrees\" with the ministerial code and \"in this instance the system worked\" because the Speaker had responded to Mr Ashworth.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Mr Christiansen's favourite Lego is the build-what-you want box of bricks.\n\nDanish toy giant Lego plans to recruit hundreds of computer experts in the UK, Denmark and China to expand its digital games and online sales operation.\n\nIn 2020, the company saw its fastest sales growth in five years, helped by locked-down families buying bigger Lego sets they could make together.\n\nBut a new Super Mario set, which blends physical bricks with online games, has been one of the biggest launches ever.\n\nBoss Niels Christiansen told the BBC Lego would speed up its digital plans.\n\nThe company has just released Lego VIDIYO, a partnership with Universal Music, which allows children to make their own music videos with special effects and filters.\n\n\"For the past two years we've made large-scale investments in initiatives designed to support long-term growth,\" the Lego chief executive said.\n\n\"We are accelerating our digital transformation. This is a big investment area for customers and suppliers,\" he said.\n\nHe told the BBC that every 2.77 seconds \"someone uploads a Lego creation to our digital platforms that they have created and want to share. The Lego community is based on the brick, but this shows there is no limit to where we can take this.\"\n\nWhile the Lego brick will always be at the heart of the business, he said: \"Today's children are growing up in a digital world and they effortlessly blend online and physical play.\"\n\nThe stores are key to building the \"brand experience\", the chief executive said.\n\nThe digital expansion will mean recruiting more computer games and website specialists over the next couple of years, said Mr Christiansen, who praised the UK's expertise in this sector. \"We go where the talent is available. Where we find the best talent is in UK and Denmark. I think the number will be in the hundreds.\n\n\"We have a solid digital foundation, but must move faster. The past year has shown the importance of having an agile, responsive business built on strong digital foundations,\" Mr Christiansen said.\n\nIn addition to its 17 stores - and another due to open in Edinburgh soon - Lego has two UK offices and employs almost 750 people.\n\nDespite store closures across the world due to the pandemic, and temporary production shutdowns at factories in China and Mexico, Lego saw a 19% jump in profits to 12.9bn Danish kroner (\u00a31.5bn) for 2020. Revenues rose 13% to 43.7bn kroner (\u00a35bn). Sales growth in all Lego's markets was in the double-digits.\n\nMr Christiansen said there had been an increase in sales of bigger, more complicated Lego sets. \"Instead of buying Lego sets for kids, families were buying big sets and building them together,\" he said. And the growth in interest for adult Lego sets continues, he added.\n\nA strong seller in 2020 - and a favourite of Mr Christiansen - was a complex Lamborghini car. However, his number one favourite is the traditional build-what-you-want box of bricks, which consistently remains in Lego's top ten best sellers each year.\n\nLego is investing heavily to build the brand in China\n\nDespite the pandemic, Lego continued with store openings - with another 134 new shops, including 91 in China, expanding the chain to 678. Lego plans to open another 120 sites in 2021, with 80 in China where development of the brand had not been as fast as in Europe and the US.\n\nMr Christiansen said bricks and mortar remained key to Lego's growth, in large part because \"the shops are not about getting the product across the counter\".\n\nHe said: \"The stores are much more a brand-builder and experience outlet. A lot of the new stores will be in China. It makes a big, big difference if there is a store in town for creating awareness of the brand.\"\n\nThe company, founded in 1932 and still family-owned, is trying to find alternatives to plastic for its bricks. Lego said it could not give a figure for how many were made each year.\n\nMr Christiansen said Lego is investing heavily in researching new materials, but has already introduced more bio-based elements into the manufacturing. The plan remains to introduce a sustainable product by 2030.\n\nFinding a quality, long-lasting material was not as easy as people might think.\n\n\"Lego sets will be used for 40, 50 years. They will still work even though they might have been lying in the basement until brought out for the grandchildren.\n\n\"That lasting quality needs to stay there even when we sustainably source. We cannot just go out and buy that material. We are actually trying to develop it,\" he said.\n\u2022 None Barbie has best sales in more than five years",

            "content": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland's objective must be \"to eliminate\" coronavirus.\n\nShe told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that striving to get new case numbers as low as possible was the only way to keep it under control.\n\nMs Sturgeon said \"the virus won't play ball\" with any effort to maintain case numbers at a \"medium level\".\n\nThe Scottish government has begun to ease some lockdown restrictions, although a stay at home order remains.\n\nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said he did not believe coronavirus could be \"eradicated\", but said an elimination strategy of driving case numbers as low as possible would make outbreaks more manageable.\n\nThe government has brought forward some \"relatively minor\" easing of restrictions, with an increase in the number of people who are allowed to mix outdoors to begin on Friday.\n\nMs Sturgeon will set out a more detailed timetable for lifting lockdown next week, with the government aiming to return to a regional \"levels\" system of local restrictions by late April.\n\nShe told MSPs that the country was \"heading firmly in the right direction right now\", but said \"we cannot afford to take our foot off the brake too soon\".\n\nThe vaccination programme is widely seen as being one of the key ways out of the pandemic\n\nThe first minister told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that the exit from lockdown \"may be slower than everyone wants it to be\".\n\nShe said her focus was for easing to be \"steady and one-directional\", rather than going too quickly and taking \"one step forward and two steps back\".\n\nMs Sturgeon backed an \"elimination\" strategy of driving virus levels as low as possible.\n\nShe said: \"With a virus like this, what you absolutely can't do is just say we're going to let it simmer at this medium level, like a gently simmering pot.\n\n\"You can't just say you'll accept X number of cases a year and X number of deaths and X number of hospitalisations a year. The virus won't behave, it won't play ball with you like that.\n\nShe added: \"You have to have an approach, in my view, where our objective has to be to eliminate. Even if you don't quite achieve elimination it is the act of trying to get it as low as possible that keeps it under control.\"\n\nThe Scottish Greens believed that if elimination was achievable there had to be a \"step up\" on testing and better support for those who needed to self-isolate.\n\nMSP Mark Ruskell, who sits on the committee, said: \"It is welcome that the first minister has moved away from talking about suppression of the virus and is now talking about eliminating it. The Scottish Greens support an elimination strategy, as pursued by countries like New Zealand, but to get there we need to see more ambition on testing and support to self-isolate.\"\n\nHe added that when restrictions are \"gradually lifted\", workplaces would need the support of a \"robust testing regime\" to prevent the virus from spreading.\n\nDr Gregor Smith said driving case numbers low would allow for outbreaks to be managed, in the same way as outbreaks of infectious diseases like measles.\n\nHe said: \"What we mean by eliminate is not to eradicate the virus. Its my view that we won't eradicate Coronavirus.\n\n\"But what we can do on a regional basis and gradually expand that internationally is to drive these numbers down to as low a level as possible so it has as little impact on communities as is possible in morbidity and mortality.\n\n\"If we can do that then we can then manage the outbreaks, just as we do when we manage measles.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon faced a range of questions during the committee session, with Conservative MSP Donald Cameron saying there was a \"strong argument\" for taking stock of whether emergency powers should be extended.\n\nThe first minister said she did not want emergency legislation to be in place \"for a minute longer than it needs to be\", but said the country was still in a difficult situation and that the government needed flexibility to act.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour's Monica Lennon highlighted the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on people from lower income backgrounds.\n\nMs Sturgeon replied that there had been \"targeted investment\" to help those who needed most, saying there was \"a need for us to continue to look with a fresh eye at some of the new inequalities that have been created by the pandemic\".",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has \"corrected\" European Council President Charles Michel after he claimed the UK had imposed an \"outright ban\" on the export of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said the government had \"not blocked\" any sales to other countries.\n\nMr Michel had said his claim about the UK's position was based on \"facts\".\n\nBut the Foreign Office summoned an EU official to explain what it called the president's \"incorrect assertions\".\n\nThe argument over vaccine exports comes at a time when European leaders are under pressure over the slow distribution of jabs.\n\nIn the UK, meanwhile, more than 22.5 million people - around a third of the population - have received their first dose.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs he was \"proud\" of the progress made, adding that the UK had also donated \u00a3548m to the Covax initiative, set up to distribute vaccines around the world.\n\nThe Gavi vaccines alliance, which co-runs the scheme, told the BBC this would pay for \"more than 70 million\" of the two billion doses expected to be given this year.\n\nMr Johnson said he wanted to \"correct the suggestion from the European Council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports\", adding: \"Let me be clear: we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components.\"\n\nMr Johnson said he was against \"vaccine nationalism in all its forms\" and called on all countries to \"work together to tackle this pandemic\".\n\nAfter heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture.\n\nCharles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe.\n\nAnalysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK.\n\nBrussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this.\n\nMr Michel's bitterly disputed \"outright ban\" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines.\n\nBut the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK.\n\nIn his weekly briefing note on Tuesday, Mr Michel said: \"The United Kingdom and the United States have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory.\"\n\nAfter the UK government insisted this was not true, Mr Michel tweeted that there were \"different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines\". But he did not elaborate on this.\n\nAt the European Commission's press briefing in Brussels, spokesman Eric Mamer declined to comment on Mr Michel's statements.\n\nHe added that Mr Johnson and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had had a phone call \"some time ago\", during which he had \"assured her the UK did not have any issue when it came to the delivery of vaccines to the European Union\".\n\nThe EU was a \"very, very active exporter of vaccines, and that is not necessarily the case of all our partners\", Mr Mamer said.\n\nThe EU has faced production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.\n\nIn January, it introduced a system of controls on exports, requiring manufacturers to seek permission from national governments for planned sales.\n\nThe EU also drafted regulations which would have overridden the Northern Ireland Protocol - agreed with the UK last year - potentially allowing it to stop vaccines bound for Northern Ireland.\n\nBut it backed down following widespread criticism.",

Searches are being carried out at a building in Deal as well as on land near Ashford.\n\nThe Met said it was \"shocking and deeply disturbing\" that the arrested man was a serving officer.\n\nMs Everard's family have been kept updated, the force added.\n\nA tent has been erected outside a house in Deal and a car was earlier seen being taken away from the property.\n\nOfficers have also been carrying out searches on land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford.\n\nRetired farmer Derek Batt, 72, of nearby Fridd Farm, said officers visited his property late on Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \"They said they were investigating a missing person. I said 'is it Sarah that I have seen on TV?' and she (the officer) said 'yes'.\"\n\nMr Batt said he had not seen any suspicious activity in the area.\n\nIn a statement, the Met Police said the man and the woman had both been taken into custody at a London police station.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the arrests were \"a serious and significant development\".\n\n\"We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.\"\n\nDuring a later statement, he added the officer \"was not on duty at the time\" when Ms Everard went missing and would only confirm he had been arrested \"in connection\" with her disappearance.\n\nHe also would not say if the officer was known to the 33-year-old.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if police believed she was still alive, Mr Ephgrave replied: \"We are searching as hard as we can to find Sarah, so we really hope that is the case.\n\n\"As a father myself of four young women I can only imagine the anguish that Sarah's family are feeling at this very very difficult time.\"\n\nThe arrested woman has been held on suspicion of assisting an offender, the force has confirmed.\n\nOn Tuesday, officers searching for Ms Everard had put up a cordon outside a block of flats in Clapham near to where she was last seen on Poynders Road and sniffer dogs have been used to search the nearby Oaklands Estate and gardens.\n\nMs Everard's family said it was out of character for her to disappear\n\nOfficers were also seen searching drains along the street where Ms Everard was last seen.\n\nThe Met said officers had visited 750 homes in the area as part of the investigation and the force had received more than 120 phone calls from the public.\n\nFriends and relatives have issued appeals on social media to help find the marketing manager, who vanished on her walk home to Brixton after leaving a friend's flat in Leathwaite Road in Battersea at about 21:00 GMT.\n\nHer family has said it is out of character for her to disappear.\n\nMs Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\n\nShe is believed to have walked through Clapham Common towards her home - a journey that should have taken her about 50 minutes.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were \"with Sarah and her friends and family\".\n\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "description": "The Palace says \"recollections may vary\" but matters in the TV interview will be addressed privately.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The race issues raised by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their interview with Oprah Winfrey are \"concerning\" and \"taken very seriously\", Buckingham Palace has said.\n\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but the matters would be addressed privately.\n\nMeghan told Oprah that Harry had been asked by an unnamed family member \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\n\nThe Palace said the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\n\nThe response from Buckingham Palace came after crisis meetings involving senior royals.\n\nThe Palace had been under growing pressure to respond to the interview in which Meghan - the first mixed-race member of the modern Royal Family - said that before their son Archie was born, questions had been asked about his skin colour.\n\nPrince Harry later clarified to Oprah that the comments were not made by either the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\n\nIn other developments, Piers Morgan has stood by the comments that led to his departure from ITV's Good Morning Britain show - including that he did not \"believe a word\" of what Meghan said in the interview.\n\nIt is reported a formal complaint by the duchess has been lodged with ITV but neither representatives for the Sussexes nor ITV have confirmed this.\n\nChris Ship, the royal editor of ITV News, said in a tweet that it was believed Meghan had raised concerns about how Morgan's words \"affect the issue of mental health and what it might do to others contemplating suicide\".\n\nThe statement from the Palace, which came a day and a half after the interview was first broadcast in the US, said: \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.\n\n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\n\n\"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nIt is understood the royals wanted to carefully consider their response and to give the British public an opportunity to watch the interview first, when it was broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nThey are said to consider this a family matter and to believe they should be given the opportunity to discuss the issues privately.\n\nDowning Street has confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson has watched the interview, but his official spokesman declined to comment on the Palace's statement.\n\nAlthough likely, it was never absolutely certain that the Queen would issue a statement following the interview given by her grandson and his wife.\n\nThe risk was that any response would add to the \"royals in crisis\" narrative which is playing out across front pages and TV screens across the globe.\n\nBut having had time to discuss the claims made by Harry and Meghan, four short sentences convey the message from the Palace that this is a private family matter and the specific allegations will not be publicly addressed.\n\nThe tone is conciliatory, with reference to the Sussexes as much loved family members. There is a gentle challenge in the line \"whilst some recollections may vary\", but also an assurance that concerns will be taken seriously.\n\nAnd we can be sure that - at least as far as the UK-based royals are concerned - any bridge-building will be done in private.\n\nMeanwhile, the board of the Society of Editors has said it will \"work towards being part of the solution\" after coming under fire for its initial reaction to Meghan and Harry's interview.\n\nIt previously said it was \"not acceptable\" for the couple to make claims of racism in the press \"without providing any supporting evidence\".\n\nBut in a new statement the organisation said its earlier comments did not address that \"there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion\".\n\n\"We will reflect on the reaction our statement prompted and work towards being part of the solution,\" it added.\n\nIt comes as MPs could push for a House of Commons debate to discuss possible actions following the media's \"hounding\" of Meghan.\n\nLabour's Holly Lynch, who co-ordinated a letter from female MPs in support of Meghan in 2019, has questioned the way the press is regulated.\n\n\"How long do you continue to let that fail before you have to recognise it has failed and say 'what next?'\" she said.\n\nDuring a visit in London earlier, Prince Charles did not respond when he was asked if he had seen the interview, in which the Sussexes addressed deeply personal topics of racism, mental health, the media and other members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe UK broadcast on Monday night was watched by an average of 11.1 million people.\n\nIn it, the duchess said there had been times when she \"didn't want to be alive any more\" because she found royal life so difficult. She said she asked for help from the Palace but received none.\n\nOne of Meghan's close friends said she had been \"worried, terrified, sad\" to see the duchess's mental health problems.\n\nActress Janina Gavankar also told ITV's This Morning: \"The family and the staff were well aware of the extent of it, and though their 'recollections may vary', ours don't, because we lived through it with them.\"\n\nGavankar, who watched the TV show air with both Meghan and Harry, added the couple were \"feeling free\" since the broadcast.\n\nMeghan told Oprah that conversations about how dark Archie's skin might be when he was born took place \"in tandem\" with discussions about why he would not be given a royal title and police protection.\n\nUnder rules in place since 1917, the couple's children would not automatically become princes or princesses - unless the Queen was to intervene.",

            "content": "As well as their legal sex, the census will also ask people their gender identity for the first time\n\nPart of the census guidance for England and Wales accompanying the question on a person's sex should be withdrawn, a High Court judge has ordered.\n\nCampaign group Fair Play for Women argued it unlawfully allowed \"self-identification\" as male or female.\n\nThe guidance said people can use the sex listed on their passport - which can be changed without a legal process.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said it was asking the same question on sex it had done since 1801.\n\nAfter a court hearing on Tuesday, Mr Justice Swift ruled that the guidance should be changed to say individuals should only respond with the answer on their birth certificate or gender recognition certificate - a document which allows trans people to change their legal gender.\n\nA full judicial review will take place next week before the census day, but the judge made the interim order saying he was satisfied the campaign group was \"more likely than not to succeed\" on its case regarding the legal definition of \"sex\".\n\nTaking place in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 21 March, the census aims to provide a snapshot of the population of the country which can then be used to make decisions about services - and which this year will be used to understand the impact of the pandemic.\n\nScotland's census has been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nFor the first time, it will include a question about gender identity as well as the one about a person's legally registered sex. The decision had been welcomed by some trans people as a \"step in the right direction\".\n\nThe legal action comes after ministers abandoned plans last year to reform the Gender Recognition Act to allow people to change their birth certificates without a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria - a process known as \"self-identification\".\n\nFair Play for Women, which seeks to defend \"the sex-based rights of women and girls\", launched a crowdfunded legal action arguing that the census guidance on the question, \"What is your sex?\" was unlawful. The group called it \"sex self-identification through the back door\".\n\nThe guidance, published in the online census only, said: \"If you are considering how to answer, use the sex recorded on one of your legal documents such as a birth certificate, gender recognition certificate, or passport.\n\n\"If you are aged 16 years or over, there is a later voluntary question on gender identity. This asks if the gender you identify with is different from your sex registered at birth.\n\n\"If it is different, you can then record your gender identity.\"\n\nThe guidance opposed by Fair Play for Women only appears online - not on the paper form\n\nFair Play for Women had argued that, unlike a birth certificate, a person's sex on a passport or other legal document such as a driving licence can be altered without a formal legal process.\n\nThey argued this could potentially have the effect of \"distorting\" the data gathered in the census.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics argued that the question on sex could refer to a person's sex as recorded in any document provided by the state.\n\nSpeaking before the hearing, Dr Nicola Williams, director of Fair Play For Women, said: \"If we don't have good data on sex we can't monitor inequalities due to sex, and if we can't measure it, we can't make good policies to remedy it.\"\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said most people did not need help to answer the question on sex but it would update the guidance to advise people to use the sex recorded on their birth certificate or gender recognition certificate.\n\nA spokesperson for the ONS said: \"We are continuing to ask a binary choice, female or male, sex question on the census. This approach is unchanged since 1801.\"",

Its chairman, Philip Dunne MP told BBC News: \u201cCracking down on planned obsolescence in electrical items is key to tackling the e-waste tsunami.\n\n\u201cWe must stop using and disposing quite so much: we must take action if we are to protect the environment for generations to come.\u201d\n\nThe think tank Green Alliance has also pushed for a right to repair. Its spokeswoman Libby Peake told BBC News: \u201cThis is good news \u2013 but it\u2019s exactly what the government said it would do on leaving the EU.\n\n\u201cThe big test is whether the UK will continue to keep track with future EU standards.\u201d\n\nNew energy labels have also been introduced this month to raise the bar because most products are classed as A+, A++ or A+++ thanks to energy efficiency standards introduced by the EU.\n\nThe simplified system is based on an A-G scale, with a higher standard for each grade so that very few appliances will now make it into the top A group.\n\nEmilie Carmichael from the Energy Saving Trust said: \"Simplifying the way energy efficiency is displayed on labels will help consumers to make more informed choices to reduce their energy consumption and bills.\"\n\nThe new regulations should come into force in the summer. They reflect what was agreed by the UK and the EU member states two years ago.\n\nThey will apply in Great Britain, while EU rules will continue to apply in Northern Ireland.\n\u2022 None 'Right to repair' rules brought in for appliances",

Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nPackaging food correctly helps to avoid food spoiling and going to waste, causing higher carbon emissions. However campaign groups have urged producers to switch to packaging materials that are easier to recycle and to improve labelling so shoppers know how to dispose of each item.\n\n\"Our research has shown that almost half of grocery packaging used by supermarkets is not widely recyclable, so it is good to see Tesco widening its recycling facilities to help consumers dispose of packaging in a more sustainable way,\" said Michael Briggs, Head of Sustainability at consumer group Which?.\n\n\"To further reduce the waste that goes to landfill, the government should make recycling labels on food packaging mandatory, simple and clear, enabling shoppers to know exactly how to dispose of packaging on the products they consume.\"\n\nIn 2018 Which? examined the packaging of a typical household shop at eleven UK supermarkets. It found only 52% of the packaging could go into household recycling bins and that 42% of products lacked adequate labelling.\n\nWhich? pinpointed products like KitKat, Babybel and Pringles, that came in packaging that was particularly challenging to dispose of.\n\nLast year, Which? examined the recyclability of 89 branded grocery products sold in UK supermarkets.\n\nOnly 30 of the 89 items were in fully recyclable packaging.\n\nWhen it grouped the items into categories, it found that some products had packaging that was particularly difficult to recycle. For example, 93% of the packaging generated by the snacks and crisps products could not be recycled, either at the kerbside or at collection points.\n\nDavid Moon, head of business collaboration at Wrap, which campaigns to reduce packaging waste, also welcomed Tesco's move as \"a step in the right direction\".\n\n\"We need all supermarkets to collect all plastic films, adopt consistent messaging and share their insights to make this work,\" he added.\n\nWrap said its research showed at least a quarter of people would be wiling to take plastic bags and wrappers back to the supermarket, but that the key was to make sure the services were convenient to use.\n\nMany UK brands and retailers have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact, committing them to remove by 2025 all packaging that cannot be recycled. Several have introduced in-store recycling collections.\n\nSainsbury's, the UK's second largest supermarket, collects and recycles carrier bags and some other soft plastic packaging, such as the bags that apples and pears are sold in. Items can be handed to home delivery drivers or taken into stores.\n\nSainsbury's is also trialling the collection in some stores of polypropylene film and plastic, typically used to wrap salad, frozen food and cakes.\n\nWaitrose said it also accepted carrier bags and plastic films, during deliveries and in-store and was currently planning a trial to expand the flexible plastics it accepts.\n\nMorrisons said it was reducing plastic use overall and already had in-store recycling bins to collect plastic bags, films and wraps.\n\nThe Co-op has trialled collection at 50 of its stores of a range of plastic types similar to those that Tesco plans to collect.\n\nWrap said that overall, the UK recycled about half of its plastic packaging.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Traditionally the Palace protects the family by drawing a curtain between the public, formal stuff and the personal stuff; its refusal to comment on the personal is a strategic interpretation of the family's maxim - \"never explain, never complain\".\n\nThe public/personal divide has always been an artifice. Royals get married in front of tens of millions of people, have state funerals, release photos on birthdays and anniversaries, exchange insights into their lives in return for easy-going and generous coverage.\n\nBut the divide, however often disregarded, remains the guiding principle of the family's formal relationship with the outside world. Now the contradictions that spring from the mix of personal and public are playing out.\n\nSome key allegations are about the personal behaviour and comments of members of the Royal Family and how, through collective neglect and perhaps some malicious intent, they left Harry and Meghan no choice but to leave.\n\nOther statements painted a terrible portrait of unfeeling staff and courtiers. The entire institution was portrayed as if nothing had been learnt from the days of Diana - Prince Harry and Prince William's late mother.\n\nThe duchess is a formidable communicator and has proved herself a very bad woman to pick a fight with. A newly-liberated Harry spoke with almost-eloquence.\n\nMeghan dealt some of the heaviest blows. What is the Palace to say about the accusation that an unnamed member of the family made a comment - more than one by the sounds of things - about the skin colour of the couple's child-to-be? The mind boggles.\n\nBut alongside the personal pain and anger rippling through the duchess's testimony, there came from Harry condemnation of the institution - the suggestion that it was incapable of change, incapable of love, incapable of understanding.\n\nThe contradictions of the Palace, and of the monarchy, are exactly that which makes it so special, so strange, so interesting and so difficult to work within - the merging of personal and public roles, the accretion of tradition, the mix of public accountability, ceaseless media interest and the need to remain relevant.\n\nHarry's suggestion that his family too - his father Prince Charles, his brother Prince William - are \"trapped\" in their world, and that he felt \"compassion\" for them, was a velvet-covered knife into the heart of the modern monarchy.\n\nRoyal life is conducted from within a gilded cage; the players are not meant to rattle the bars from the outside.\n\nThese are the contradictions Harry walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. He was uncomfortable with them before he was married. And when he saw his wife suffering as a result of his being \"trapped\" in royal life, he found a way out with her.\n\nThere are also the contradictions that lie behind many of the decisions that they both spoke out about and are clearly very unhappy about.\n\nIt is public money that pays for security. It is tradition that dictates who gets what title. There is no HR department for working royals because it is a family affair. What you do in front of the cameras matters because it reflects on the institution as a whole.\n\nThis meshing of personal and public is unique. It is what being a modern royal is all about. And inside it is often a hugely uncomfortable place to be. Harry knew that. Presumably he warned Meghan. But that warning wasn't enough.\n\nHarry and Meghan's experience suggests that the contradictions are too great. Maybe their interview will act as a catalyst for change. But the Crown has been around for a very long time, and change does not come easily to a body in which the past plays such an outsize role.",

Money mules are given a cut for allowing their account to be used. Often they ask no questions over the source of the money.\n\nMost are young men. Those who try to quit may be threatened with violence by the criminals who recruited them.\n\nIf they are caught, they could face prison, as well as future difficulties with their finances, such as having their bank account closed and finding it difficult to apply for credit in the future, such as mobile phone contract.\n\nThere were 17,157 cases of suspected money muling activity involving 21 to 30-year-olds in 2020, a 5% increase on the previous year, according to the latest figures from Cifas.\n\nKaty Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"Criminals are cruelly preying on 'generation Covid' and those struggling to find work at this difficult time, by using fake job adverts online to recruit people as money mules.\n\n\"We would urge everyone to remain cautious. At the same time, online platforms must take swift action to detect and take down content being used to promote money muling activity.\"\n\nSocial media is used to attract money mules\n\nThe figures also show that cases among the under 21s had dropped, possibly owing to the fact teenagers have spent less time out and at school, where they could have been recruited.\n\nThis helped to push down the total number of reported cases slightly compared with 2019.\n\n\"Have you ever held \u00a32,000 at once in your hand?\" That was the line used to tempt Holly into becoming a money mule.\n\nAt the age of 17 and still at school, Holly (not her real name) was approached on Instagram, then Snapchat, by a person who promised to pay her a decent sum, if she let him use her bank account to move money.\n\n\"I just eventually gave in,\" she said.\n\nOther scams seen during the pandemic include impersonation fraud, in which con-artists pretend to be from broadband providers, TV streaming services, or energy suppliers to trick victims into handing over money.\n\nRomance scams have exploited the lonely, scam adverts have had a Covid theme, and fraudsters have posed as banks' fraud departments to gather personal details, according to TSB, which has a guarantee to refund blameless victims.\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic, we have seen an increase in sophisticated attacks on the public. Banks and other businesses need to step up their efforts to protect their customers and help catch the criminals,\" said Ashley Hart, head of fraud at TSB.",

She has always denied the charges against her.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister spoke to Iranian president Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday afternoon, and raised the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran \"and demanded their immediate release\".\n\nThe spokesman added: \"He said that while the removal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's ankle monitor was welcome, her continued confinement remains completely unacceptable and she must be allowed to return to her family in the UK.\"\n\nMr Johnson, while stressing that the UK remains committed to making the Iran nuclear deal a success, also demanded that Iran cease all of its nuclear activity which breaches the deal, the spokesman said.\n\n\"He stressed the importance of Iran seizing the opportunity presented by the United States' willingness to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance,\" he said.\n\n\"The prime minister underlined the need for Iran to cease wider destabilising activity and be a positive force in the Gulf region.\"\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband Richard Ratcliffe, who has not seen his wife in person since she left the UK in 2016\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, had been out of prison since last spring due to the coronavirus pandemic but had been confined to her parents' house.\n\nShe was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\n\nThe dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denies.\n\nSpeaking after her ankle tag was removed, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said it was \"a mixed day for us\" and \"Nazanin is genuinely happy\" to be free of her electronic bracelet.\n\n\"I'm a bit more guarded - it feels to me like they have made one blockage just as they have removed another, and we very clearly remain in the middle of this government game of chess,\" he said.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018\n\nAs of Sunday, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had not had her British passport returned to her, according to Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in London where her family live.\n\nMs Siddiq told the BBC: \"She does have to go back to court and we don't know what awaits her there.\n\n\"Nazanin is quite worried because there was talk of another case being put against her which may of course mean another sentence, and we don't know how long for.\"\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence has included eight months of solitary confinement, blindfolded interrogations and hunger strikes to press for medical treatment.\n\nPrior to her arrest, she lived in London with her husband and child.\n\nIn November, she was taken to court on fresh charges of spreading propaganda against the Iranian regime.\n\nHer family and the UK government have always maintained her innocence and she has been given diplomatic protection by the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran.\n\nMr Ratcliffe believes his wife and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The owner of Wagamama is seeking to raise millions of pounds after many of its restaurants had to close their doors amid lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe Restaurant Group (TRG) will seek to raise \u00a3175m from its shareholders to pay down debt and use as a buffer in case of any Covid resurgence.\n\nIts boss said the pandemic had presented \"enormous challenges\" for the sector.\n\nTotal sales dropped by 57% to \u00a3459.8m in 2020 as many TRG sites were closed.\n\nDented sales and pandemic costs meant the group, which also owns other restaurant chains such as Frankie & Benny's, reported a \u00a3127.6m pre-tax loss last year, compared to a \u00a337.3m loss in 2019.\n\nIt added that its short-term outlook remains \"uncertain\" while lockdown restrictions remain in place.\n\nChief executive Andy Hornby said that TRG has \"responded decisively\" to restructure the businesses while preserving the \"maximum number of long-term roles for our colleagues\".\n\n\"Whilst the sector outlook remains uncertain, and we are mindful of continuing restrictions across the UK, we are confident that the actions announced today will allow us to emerge as one of the long-term winners.\"\n\nUnder the prime minister's current \"roadmap\" for easing lockdown restrictions, hospitality venues will be able to reopen for customers dining outside 12 April at the earliest, with indoor dining set for 17 May.\n\nDuring the pandemic, TRG started a major restructuring, closing about 250 sites, which largely affected staff across its Frankie & Benny's, Chiquito and Food & Fuel brands.\n\nIt also tapped investors for cash last April, raising \u00a354.6m from a share placing.\n\nThe firm, which now has about 400 restaurants, pubs and concessions, said the additional funds it planned to raise would be the \"last step\" in the restructuring plan as it prepares to reopen sites once restrictions lift.\n\nIt said Wagamama delivered \"exceptional\" like-for-like sales growth when it was open for dine-in trading and that the Wagamama restaurants operating takeaways and delivery services saw sales two and a half times higher than pre-Covid levels.\n\nBut Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it could take some time for pent-up demand to \"unleash\" as restaurants reopen.\n\n\"Many of The Restaurant Group's sites have limited outdoor seating so are unlikely to fully benefit from the phased opening of the hospitality industry from 12 April,\" she said.\n\n\"The cash injection from this latest rights issue will give it some breathing space but there may well be more restructuring pain to come, as a slimmed down version of Restaurant Group emerges from the crisis.''\n\nSeparately, the owner of delivery giant Just Eat said on Wednesday that it expected orders to ramp up further in 2021.\n\nDutch-based Just Eat Takeaway.com reported a sharp increase in sales of \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) in 2020, up 54% from \u20ac1.6bn the previous year. It said this was due to a 42% leap in online orders.\n\nUK food orders increased 35% over the year and the group said this had accelerated further under current lockdown measures.\n\nMcDonald's and Greggs orders have proven popular with UK customers during lockdown.\n\nJust Eat Takeaway said UK orders were 88% higher in the first two months of 2021, with delivery orders up by more than 600% compared with a year earlier.\n\nPartnerships with chains such as Greggs and McDonald's were particularly popular with UK customers, it added.\n\nHowever, despite the high demand for home deliveries, the platform reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac147m euros against \u20ac88m in 2019. It said the figure reflected costs associated with the group's takeover of GrubHub in the US and the merger of Just Eat with Takeaway.com.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, added that a \"number of potential clouds\" could be on the horizon for the group.\n\n\"Competition in the space is intense and, in the post-pandemic world, it is impossible to guarantee that its business model will continue to generate such strong growth as the easing of lockdown restrictions allow the global population to visit restaurants in person once more,\" he said.",

He had not seen the video of Floyd's death, he said.\n\nThe second juror, who appeared to be of mixed race and in her 20s, said she had seen the video only once and was eager to hear all the evidence as a juror.\n\nThe third juror, an auditor, who was white, said that he would also examine guilt or innocence only from what is presented in the trial. All three swore to keep an open mind and weigh all the proof presented in determining the outcome of the high-profile case.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March. Jury selection continues on Wednesday. A total of 14 jurors are needed to make up the panel and alternates. George Floyd death: How will jurors be selected?",

            "content": "Hannah, Rob and Cathryn are celebrating an extraordinary find\n\n\"We're still pinching ourselves - to believe that this actually happened on our drive!\"\n\nRob Wilcock, his wife Cathryn and daughter Hannah are astounded to find themselves at the centre of a major scientific discovery.\n\nIt was their property in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, that was hit by the most valuable space rock ever to fall on the UK.\n\nThe meteorite has had British scientists in raptures of joy.\n\nIt's a carbonaceous chondrite - a dark stony material that retains unaltered chemistry from the formation of our Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, and, as such, could give us fresh insights on how the planets came into being.\n\nThe first thing the Wilcock family knew about it was when they heard a dull thud outside their house on the night of Sunday 28 February.\n\n\"When I heard it drop, I stood up and looked out the window to see what was there,\" recalled Hannah. \"But because it was dark I couldn't see anything.\n\n\"It was only the next morning when we went out that we saw it on the drive - a bit like a kind of splatter. And in all honesty, my original thought was - has someone been driving around the Cotswolds lobbing lumps of coal into people's gardens?\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"Either that or someone had upturned a barbecue tray,\" chimed in Cathryn.\n\nScientists knew fragments of a meteorite must be in the Gloucestershire area. Their cameras had recorded the rock coming through the atmosphere that Sunday night, creating a huge fireball in the process.\n\nImagery from multiple angles allowed researchers to narrow the drop zone, and when they went on the media to make an appeal on the Monday, they hoped one or two people might come forward with an interesting find.\n\nIn fact, they were inundated with pictures. Most had nothing to do with meteorites, but when Open University planetary scientist Richard Greenwood looked at the Wilcocks' picture, he was blown away.\n\n\"It was one of those moments when your legs start going wobbly. I saw this thing; it was like a splat across [the Wilcocks'] drive; and it had all these rays coming off it; and I just thought - that is a meteorite. It was instantaneous,\" he said.\n\nWith all the hullabaloo that was bound to follow the discovery, Rob's initial reaction was to try to stay out of the limelight - to be anonymous.\n\nBut when he thought it through a little more, Rob said the three of them recognised they should talk about what had happened to them.\n\n\"We've been wrestling with the question of whether we should talk about it, and in the end we decided we should. There seems to be such a lot of genuine public interest in the find,\" Rob told BBC News.\n\n\"We're absolutely thrilled that something that's going to be so valuable to science, to the human understanding of the world and of the Solar System has happened, and that we can be a small part in it.\"\n\nThe family have donated the meteorite remains to the national collection held by the Natural History Museum in London. They were determined the rock should not go to a dealer, but to science.\n\nThe last meteorite fall to be picked up in the UK was 30 years ago. That was an \"ordinary chondrite\" - a common type of space rock.\n\nThe Winchcombe meteorite is far more valuable. Studying its chemistry - and what it can tell us about the conditions that went into building the planets - will keep scientists busy for years.\n\nAs for the small Gloucestershire market town - it's now firmly on the map.\n\n\"We always felt that the Cotswolds is a wonderful place to live. But now the whole world seems to know about us,\" reflected one local resident on Tuesday afternoon.",

Many died of disease and starvation, while others were gassed, shot or given lethal injections.\n\nThe victims included many Jews as well as non-Jewish Poles and captured Soviet soldiers.\n\nThe west German court said in a statement on Wednesday that \"due to his physical condition,\" Harry S \"was no longer able to reasonably represent his interest in and outside of the trial\".\n\nBut it went on to say that, as a guard at the camp, he would have overseen the transports and \"recognised the scope and dimension of the mass murder committed\" there.\n\nAs there was a \"a high degree of probability\" of his guilt, Harry S should pay his own expenses, the court ruled. It is not known how much the costs are, or whether the defendant will appeal.\n\nStutthof was officially designated a concentration camp in 1942. It was the first such camp built outside German borders in the war and the last to be liberated, by the Soviet army on 9 May 1945.\n\nMore than 65,000 people are thought to have died in the camp. Guards began using gas chambers there in June 1944.\n\nGermany has been pursuing former Nazi camp workers since a landmark ruling in 2011 that convicted a former guard, John Demjanjuk, as an accessory to mass murder. He died pending an appeal, but the verdict set a legal precedent.\n\nPreviously, courts had required evidence of former SS guards' direct involvement in atrocities.",

            "content": "Parents urged not to pressure teachers over exam grades\n\nTeachers will be responsible for deciding grades this year\n\nParents should not pressurise teachers, but trust their judgement as they award GCSE and A-level grades this summer, says England's exams regulator.\n\nFor the second year running, teachers' grades will be used following the cancellation of exams due to Covid-19.\n\nSimon Lebus, acting head of Ofqual, said teachers' judgement was considered to be \"pretty reliable\".\n\nBut he urged parents not to put teachers under pressure or make them \"uncomfortable\" over grade decisions.\n\nThe acting chief regulator was giving evidence to the Commons Education Select Committee on Tuesday.\n\nHe told MPs: \"We've created a system in which I think there are good incentives to allow teacher judgment to flourish and we've all got to play our part to support that.\"\n\nHe added: \"I also think it's very important that parents give teachers the space to do it, because it's always a worry that parents get terribly involved and teachers feel uncomfortable and there's an intrusive interest so I think that's a really important point.\"\n\nEngland's Schools Minister Nick Gibb, who also appeared before the committee, said there were no plans to get rid of exams on a permanent basis, following two years of cancelled assessments due to the pandemic.\n\nMr Gibb denied suggestions that exams could be phased out and said \"I absolutely can confirm\" that they would be kept in future years.\n\n\"What we have learnt is that exams are the fairest way of judging the attainment and ability and work of students and we want to get back to exams as soon as possible.\"\n\nMr Gibb told MPs that, up until 4 January exams were going ahead - with various systems in place to account for the disruption to learning.\n\n\"It was only after the decision to close schools to most pupils from January, that we decided that the unfairness was too great.\"\n\nAsked about the extra pressure on teachers this year, especially in terms of awarding grades for GCSEs and A-levels, Mr Gibb acknowledged that they had \"shouldered a huge burden\" and that the Department for Education was \"conscious of workload\".\n\nIan Bauckham, acting chair of Ofqual, said teachers were being asked to \"step up and do more than they usually have to do by playing a significant part in the determination of grades\".\n\n\"We need to make sure the exam boards give them the structures and incentives to do the job, they can see needs doing, well.\n\n\"And I think that being clear that everyone will be subject to the same quality assurance, the same checks - that gives confidence to do the right thing in each individual circumstance.\"\n\nHe said these structures would help teachers not to \"bow to the various pressures that they will undoubtedly come under\" from pupils and parents.\n\nMr Baukham said it was up to senior leadership teams in school to make sure teachers got the \"support and structure they needed\".\n\nMr Gibb also told MPs that it was \"good to see children back in school\" this week in England.\n\nAsked about Covid testing, the minister said that a negative PCR test would not over-rule a positive lateral flow test taken by a pupil in school under supervision, but would over-rule a lateral flow test done at home.",

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "The con woman known as \"the fake heiress\" for posing as a wealthy socialite in New York says she is trying to make the best of her newfound infamy since her release from prison.\n\nWhen asked if crime pays, Anna Sorokin told BBC Newsnight: \"In a way, it did.\"\n\nSorokin was paid $320,000 (\u00a3230,000) by Netflix for her story and says she has been offered other deals.\n\nShe went to jail after tricking banks, hoteliers and friends out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe story of her exploits - under the pseudonym Anna Delvey - went viral in New York Magazine in 2018, sparking instant interest from TV producers.\n\n\"I never asked for Netflix to buy my story, it just happened,\" says Sorokin, who was released on parole in February after more than three years behind bars. \"And everything else, it just spun out of my control. It's not like I orchestrated anything.\"\n\nSorokin was not able to keep all the Netflix money, owing to a New York law that prevents criminals from profiting from their notoriety. The company fully complied with the law and the authorities froze Sorokin's bank account, allowing her victims to make claims to it first. At least $170,000 was used to pay back banks.\n\nSorokin turned 30 in prison, but she was in her mid-twenties when she spent time in New York City, telling people she had a $60m trust fund and an ambitious project to create an eponymous arts foundation.\n\nShe was, in fact, a recent magazine intern, who came from an ordinary family of Russian immigrants living in Germany. By staying in expensive hotels and presenting a jetset life on Instagram, she managed to trick others into believing her fantasy and picking up her bills. Using fake documents, she even convinced a bank to give her a $100,000 overdraft, before the police finally tracked her down.\n\nSorokin now claims the prosecution played a major role in creating her media persona during her high-profile trial.\n\n\"The prosecution totally misrepresented my motives. They said I paraded around New York, posing as an heiress. What happened was strictly between me and financial institutions, it was none of their business. They portrayed me as a wannabe socialite party girl and that was never my goal,\" she says.\n\nAnna Sorokin was sentenced in May 2019\n\nThough Sorokin did enjoy champagne lunches and luxury holidays, she primarily had her sights set on creating her arts foundation and she fraudulently sought a $22m loan to try to get it off the ground. She even produced a high-end brochure (but never paid the designer) and claimed to have the backing of celebrity artists, such as the late Cristo, for the launch party. (Before the artist died last year, his publicist told the BBC the claim was pure fabrication.)\n\nSorokin's defence was also built around a \"fake it until you make it\" narrative. Her lawyer told The Cut he enlisted a stylist so she could keep up appearances in the courtroom.\n\nAsked now when Anna Sorokin started to become Anna Delvey, she says: \"I always was Anna Delvey.\"\n\n\"[Others] portrayed me as someone very manipulative, which I don't think I am,\" she says. \"I was never too nice of a person. I was never trying to talk my way into anything. I just told people what I wanted and they gave it to me, or I would move on.\"\n\nSorokin was found guilty of four counts of theft of services, three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny in April 2019. She was acquitted of two other charges.\n\nSince her release from prison, she says she has been inundated with media requests and she has hired her own filmmaker to take control of her narrative. \"I am writing my book, I have my NFT [non-fungible tokens] project, and my merch, and [I am working on] prison reform,\" she says. \"I am trying to turn the attention I am getting into something positive.\"\n\nActress Julia Garner - who has the lead role in Netflix's Inventing Anna, out later this year - visited Sorokin in prison\n\nShe insists she does not consider being a convicted con artist as a badge of honour.\n\nOn social media, however, she is not shying away from this reputation. Earlier this week, she tweeted an image of a stack of books themed on money and trickery, including Den of Thieves and The Biggest Bluff.\n\nThough she has previously spoken of regret, she now says that is not the right word, because that implies sadness and she is not sad about what she did, even though she wouldn't do it again.\n\nHer lawyer, Todd Spodek, told the BBC that she is working on an appeal and he anticipates that she will be deported back to Germany in due course.\n\nSorokin says she will try to stay in the US.\n\nThis story is based on Anna Sorokin's interview with Emily Maitlis for BBC Newsnight.
