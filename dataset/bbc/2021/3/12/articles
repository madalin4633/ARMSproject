            "content": "A Sarah Everard vigil could still be held tomorrow in London even though a judge this evening refused to intervene in a legal challenge against it being currently banned from going ahead.\n\nMr Justice Holgate refused to grant a specific order against the Metropolitan Police, which yesterday had said the event planned for Saturday evening in London would be unlawful. But he left the door open for new talks between demonstrators and senior officers.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling came after the force told the court it recognised that it could not have a blanket ban on protests under the coronavirus regulations.\n\nThe conclusion of Friday's High Court action means that while the judge said he could not get involved in what had happened so far, Scotland Yard has also accepted it must consider the legal right to protest before deciding whether to ban protests under coronavirus health regulations.\n\nThat raises the prospect of the organisers reaching an agreement with the police that would allow a demonstration in London and other places around the country.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, lawyers for four women organising the vigil under the Reclaim These Streets banner told the court that the Metropolitan Police had said there was nothing they could do to allow the protest to take place.\n\nSenior officers had said their \"hands were tied\" by the Covid lockdown laws which banned all gatherings outdoors.\n\nBut as the hearing continued, the force's own lawyer denied that it had a blanket ban on protests during the pandemic - but it was concerned about the health implications of a large gathering.\n\nThe judge said: \"There may well be further communication between the claimants and the police to deal with the application of the [Covid] regulations and [the rights to protest]. But that is not a matter on which the court should comment.\"",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Uber and rival app Lyft plan to share with each other the names of US drivers they ban from their platforms because of \"serious\" safety incidents, such as sexual assault.\n\nThe two firms said the programme, to be managed by a background check company, was aimed at improving industry safety.\n\nThey said other US firms could opt to participate.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft have faced scrutiny and legal action over their handling of sexual assault and other safety issues.\n\nThey have responded to the criticism by introducing measures such as recurring background checks and new features, such as emergency buttons in their apps.\n\nThe new programme, which is only active in the US, will also allow the two firms to share information about drivers involved in certain serious incidents such as rape and non-consensual kissing, as well as non-sexual physical assaults.\n\nScott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the effort meant \"perpetrators will no longer be able to hide or escape accountability by simply switching ridesharing platforms\".\n\n\"By putting aside competition, they are placing users first and building a safer rideshare community for all,\" he said in the announcement shared by the companies on Thursday.\n\nLawyer Kristen Barton of Estey & Bomberger, which represents women who have sued the ridesharing companies for inadequate protections from sexual violence, called the programme a \"step in the right direction\".\n\nBut she cautioned that the database's usefulness would be limited by its focus on drivers that the companies have banned.\n\n\"There's no guarantee that when a report against a driver is lodged that that is being followed up on and resulting in deactivation by the companies,\" she said, adding that only a small number of people who are assaulted even report the incident.\n\n\"While it is a good start, it's just not going to capture enough information to stop assaults from occurring,\" she said.\n\nIn 2019, Uber said it had received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the US in the previous two years. It said problems arose in a tiny fraction of the 2.3 billion rides during that time.\n\nIt later clashed with state regulators in California, who wanted access to the reports, ultimately leading to a fine.\n\nLyft has delayed publication of a similar report, citing the privacy disagreement. The company is also facing lawsuits from dozens of women in the US, who say they were harmed after the firm failed to protect passengers from its drivers.\n\nLyft is active in the US and Canada. Uber, which operates in 71 countries around the world, said the data-sharing initiative was limited to the US, with no plans to expand at this time.\n\nThe firm has faced concerns over its handling of safety incidents outside the US as well.\n\nIn the UK, Uber had its London licence suspended, in part because of safety concerns. However, in September last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled the firm could continue operating, saying it had improved its record despite \"historical failings\".",

We're still being told to contact our friends when we get home, making sure we dress in bright clothing, making sure we don't walk in dark areas, we walk home in groups,\" she said.\n\n\"The conversation around safety of women is so focused on women that we don't think about the role men have to play in this as well.\"\n\nMost women \"don't know a woman who hasn't faced some sort of abuse or sexual violence in their life\", according to Cerys Furlong, chief executive of gender equality charity Chwarae Teg.\n\nShe said one in five girls and women aged 14 to 21 have experienced sexual harassment in public since the start of lockdown.\n\n\"We need to look quickly and clearly at why there are so few convictions and why as a society we don't have confidence in women and believe them when they speak out,\" Ms Furlong told BBC Radio Wales.\n\nThe chief constable of North Wales Police said Sarah Everard's death has \"brought into sharp focus the fact that everyone, wherever they are, should be able to live, work and walk our streets without fear of harassment, abuse or violence\".\n\nCarl Foulkes urged women to report \"any concerns about behaviour in complete confidence that the police will deal with that concern\".\n\n\"Tackling abuse and violence in all its forms is a priority for us. We are absolutely committed to doing all we can to prevent this and to prosecute those who commit or attempt to commit such offences,\" he said.\n\nThere have been calls from some for men to be given curfew in the wake of Ms Everard's disappearance.\n\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he was not considering a curfew on men after a row over comments he made on BBC Breakfast television.\n\nOn the show he said a curfew would not be not be \"top of the list\" to combat sexual harassment, he would be willing to \"consider all options\" if there was a \"crisis\".\n\nHe said the Welsh Government changed the rules over the winter to allow people to exercise with one other person to help keep people safe.\n\nAlthough the Welsh Parliament can create offences in areas controlled from Cardiff, most criminal law is controlled from Westminster.\n\nAfter Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said such a curfew would be \"barmy\", Mr Drakeford tweeted: \"We are NOT introducing a curfew for men in Wales - or even considering it. This is misleading and deliberately misses the real issue.\"\n\nWe are NOT introducing a curfew for men in Wales \u2013 or even considering it. This is misleading and deliberately misses the real issue.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a sad distraction when what\u2019s needed is a proper discussion about women\u2019s safety and why a woman is killed every 3 days by a man in the UK. \u2014 Mark Drakeford (@fmwales) March 12, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

I'm sure fans of Eggheads will share in my delight that it has found a new home on Channel 5.\"\n\nVine already presents a daily mid-morning news and debate programme for the network, after taking over the slot from The Wright Stuff in 2018.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \"We sometimes have to make difficult decisions in order to grow new shows and we would like to thank the Eggheads and host Jeremy Vine for their time on the BBC and wish them well with their next chapter.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "section": "US & Canada",
            "content": "President Joe Biden has said he is hopeful that America can \"mark independence\" from Covid-19 on 4 July if people get vaccinated.\n\nIn his first primetime address as president, Mr Biden said he would order states to make all adults eligible for vaccinations by 1 May.\n\nMr Biden was speaking exactly a year to the day after the outbreak was classified a global pandemic.\n\nHalf a million Americans have since died - more than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined.\n\nSchools have been closed, businesses shuttered and people kept apart.\n\nLast year many Americans were forced to forgo the elaborate parades, fireworks displays and parties that feature in the national holiday on 4 July, which marks independence from Britain.\n\nIn his speech, President Biden said he did not expect large events to be able to go ahead, but he hoped small groups could meet again.\n\n\"If we do this together, by 4 July, there is a good chance you, your family and friends can get together in your backyard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day,\" he said.\n\n\"After a long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day truly special - where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.\"\n\nCelebrations on the National Mall in Washington were marked with social distancing and face masks in 2020\n\nIt was a long way from the huge crowds that normally gather, such as seen here in 2019\n\nThe US has by far the highest death toll in the world from the virus, but death and infection rates have been declining in recent weeks as the vaccine programme picks up.\n\nThe country's health system is complex and individual states are in charge of public health policy. While the federal government is responsible for getting the vaccine distributed to the states, it has largely relied on them to handle the distribution.\n\nBut as part of the plans to expand vaccinations, President Biden said the number of places where people could be immunised would be increased, with veterinarians and dentists among those also allowed to vaccinate people.\n\nMobile units will travel into local communities to provide vaccinations in underserved communities, he said.\n\nMr Biden previously set a target of 100 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office. But in his address on Thursday, he said this target would be reached on day 60, which is 20 March.\n\nHe was speaking shortly after signing a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) economic relief bill, which marks an early legislative victory for his administration. It includes a $1,400 direct payment to most Americans, along with other measures to help people out of poverty and provide additional funding to local and state governments.\n\nDespite the good news on vaccinations, Mr Biden warned that the \"fight is far from over\".\n\nHe called on people to maintain social distancing measures, hand washing and wear a mask.\n\n\"Beating the virus and getting back to normal relies on national unity,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden said last month he hoped that life would return to \"normal\" by Christmas 2021. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, described this timetable as \"reasonable\".\n\nThe president's caution is at odds with some states such as Texas and Mississippi, which are relaxing restrictions in order to boost their economies.\n\nOne year ago, the United States joined the world in facing a brutal truth. The coronavirus pandemic was going to fundamentally alter everyday life. Businesses shuttered. Citizens sheltered in their home. Life ground to a halt.\n\nOn Thursday night, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation, President Joe Biden said there was light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThe big news from his speech was that all adult Americans would be eligible for a vaccine by the beginning of May - a pace, he boasted, that was the best in the world.\n\nHis most important message, however, may have been his urging that all Americans should get the jab when it's their turn. \"I know they're safe,\" he said.\n\nA recent opinion poll showed that nearly half of Republicans are sceptical of the vaccine. If their doubt becomes inaction, Mr Biden's promises - widespread school openings, an ability to travel and Independence Day celebrations - will go unrealised.\n\nHis speech was part promise, part warning. Get vaccinated, continue social distancing, wear masks - or else.\n\n\"America is coming back,\" he said. But, he added, Americans needed to do their part.\n\nThis time last year, there were 1,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US and about 30 people had died.\n\nAll US major sport was cancelled and then-President Donald Trump suspended travel from Europe, saying he hoped the US would be open again for Easter 2020. This prediction was repeatedly revised.\n\nThe pandemic has now left more than 530,000 people dead in the US and has infected more than 29 million.\n\nIn his speech, President Biden criticised the Trump administration by saying the virus was initially met with \"denials for days, weeks, then months, that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, more loneliness\".\n\nHe also denounced \"vicious hate crimes\" against Asian Americans, who he said had been \"attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated\" for the pandemic. Mr Trump repeatedly referred to coronavirus as the \"China virus\".",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Artist's impression of how the new mine will look\n\nA public inquiry has been announced into plans for the first new deep coal mine in the UK for decades.\n\nThe government had previously decided not to intervene in the project near Whitehaven in Cumbria, which was in the hands of local officials.\n\nBut ministers have taken control because of \"increased\" controversy.\n\nGreen campaigners say the mine will increase carbon emissions and send the wrong signal in the run-up to a UK-hosted climate conference in October.\n\nThe Woodhouse Colliery would extract coking coal for the steel industry from the seabed off St Bees, with a processing plant at Kells, in Whitehaven.\n\nCumbria County Council councillors, who have been assessing the project since 2017, gave it the go-ahead last March - but have since decided to review the application.\n\nLast month it was reported that the government's climate tsar, Alok Sharma, was apoplectic the plans for the coal mine had not been stopped.\n\nMr Sharma, who is in charge of preparations for the COP26 UN climate conference, has faced calls to resign over the issue.\n\nHe told MPs only last month that the mine was a \"local issue\" and would be decided by the council.\n\nBut the government has now decided to \"call in\" the application, meaning Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick will get the final say over it.\n\nIn a letter to Cumbria County Council, Mr Jenrick said the application had raised issues of \"more than local importance\".\n\nHe added the reversal had also been prompted by new advice on carbon emissions from government climate advisers published in December.\n\nHowever, a public inquiry will first be held by independent planners at the Planning Inspectorate. The inquiry process could take a number of months.\n\nAsked on Friday whether the government backed the mine or not, Boris Johnson said he couldn't get involved as it was now a \"qausi-judicial planning decision\".\n\nMP Trudy Harrison, whose Copeland constituency would include the mine, is a ministerial aide to the prime minister and has described opponents of the mine as being in \"cloud cuckoo land\".\n\nMs Harrison has yet to comment on the decision to hold an inquiry, but the Tory MP for nearby Workington, Mark Jenkinson, called the decision a \"capitulation to climate alarmists\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cumbria, he said the \"screeching U-turn\" could open a \"Pandora's box\" over how the UK's contribution to climate change is measured.\n\nHe added there was \"nothing on the horizon\" to replace coking coal in the process for making steel, a sector that is due to play an important role in the UK's \"green recovery\".\n\nThe government could still decide to approve the mine, but given the amount of anger it's caused that seems unlikely - at least until after the UN climate conference.\n\nLocal Conservatives strongly supported the scheme and the employment it would bring.\n\nBut the government's climate advisers, along with a crowd of green groups, warned it would increase carbon emissions when the UK's committed to cutting them.\n\nWhat's more, it would harm Britain's international reputation before the UN conference, they said.\n\nOne of the world's leading climate scientists, the American James Hansen, warned Boris Johnson risked humiliation over the mine.\n\nThe US climate envoy John Kerry warned against it on Monday. And yesterday Alok Sharma was again rebuked by MPs over the plan.\n\nIt was too much pressure.\n\nProf Rebecca Willis and Prof Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than a million households.\n\nSupporters of the mine say that by producing coal to be used in Europe, the mine will reduce emissions from shipping coal from Australia or the USA.\n\nBut the mine proposal comes at a time when the government wants every sector of the UK economy to reduce CO2 emissions - not find new sources of carbon.\n\nLabour's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband said the government should \"block\" the mine and \"provide alternative jobs in the green industries of the future\".\n\n\"We owe people a long-term secure employment situation, the mine isn't the answer,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe added that whilst there was a \"current need\" for coking coal in steelmaking, \"all experts say over time the industry's going to need to move towards hydrogen as the answer\".\n\nLib Dem Tim Farron, MP for nearby Westmoreland and Lonsdale, said: \"In the year that Britain hosts COP26, it is blindingly obviously that we won't be taken seriously on the world stage with this coal mine hanging round our neck.\"\n\nHe added: \"I hope this public inquiry leads to these plans finally being axed, and the government instead looks at bringing well-paid, long-term, green jobs to Cumbria.\"",

            "content": "Sinn F\u00e9in has refused to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his visit to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe party described his trip on Friday as a publicity stunt.\n\nMr Johnson said he was \"always happy to meet all sides\" but had been told Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn F\u00e9in was \"otherwise engaged\".\n\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster urged him ditch what she called the \"intolerable\" post-Brexit arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nIt came into effect in January as part of the Brexit deal and means Northern Ireland remains in the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK has left, so checks are required on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Mrs Foster said the protocol was unworkable, had the backing of no unionist parties and created societal division and economic harm rather than protecting the Belfast Agreement that effectively brought to an end Northern Ireland's Troubles.\n\n\"Whilst grace periods have been extended unilaterally, we need a permanent solution so business can plan and the integrity of the United Kingdom internal market can be restored,\" said Mrs Foster, speaking after meeting the prime minister at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.\n\nMr Johnson said the government's action to postpone the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol was \"lawful and indeed right in view of the impact on the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and the need to have consent from both communities\".\n\n\"The most important thing about the protocol is that it should guarantee the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"There's got to be an east-west consent... as well as a north-south consent so that's what we're doing.\"\n\nMs O'Neill, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, said she and her party's president Mary Lou McDonald had a \"long-standing request\" to meet Mr Johnson.\n\nBoris Johnson arrived at the vaccination centre at Fermanagh Lakeland Forum with NI Secretary Brandon Lewis\n\nThey wanted to discuss \"commitments which he and his government have reneged on\" as well as his \"reckless and partisan approach to the Irish protocol\", she said.\n\n\"He did not facilitate the meeting,\" added Ms O'Neill. \"I have no plans to meet with him today.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane went further, describing the prime minister's visit as a \"very superficial PR exercise\".\n\nThis visit feels like the first step in the prime minister's own pathway to recovery as he seeks to repair badly damaged relations with unionists.\n\nIt was no surprise that pathway included an early trip to Fermanagh - the home of Arlene Foster.\n\nEven before he arrived, his advance party had set the stage releasing details of events to mark Northern Ireland's centenary.\n\nBut it will take more than a special postmark, a concert and a centenary rose to heal the unionist hurt.\n\nFar from being the union's chief cheerleader, Boris Johnson is regarded by many unionists as the prime minister who betrayed Northern Ireland by agreeing to the protocol which created the Irish Sea border.\n\nIt is going to be a tricky visit for the prime minister labelled a \"lousy unionist\" by an Orange Order leader.\n\nIt is no surprise that much of the visit's focus was on the battle against Covid-19 and the successful rollout of the UK's vaccine programme.\n\nBut until he comes up with a political vaccine to eradicate the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Boris Johnson pathway to unionist recovery will not be smooth.\n\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the success of Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme \"shows the strength of the union\".\n\nBut the UUP MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) warned that the Northern Ireland Protocol had brought challenges, particularly in terms of medical supplies.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mr Johnson commended the military and emergency response teams at Aldergrove in County Antrim for their work throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nArmy medics were deployed to hospitals in Northern Ireland to assist staff dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases over the winter.\n\nMr Johnson thanked them for their \"incredible\" work in Belfast's Nightingale Hospital, where some of them gave patient care.\n\nThe prime minister also met scientists involved in vaccine research at Queen's University Belfast.\n\nHis last engagement in Northern Ireland was at medical 3D printing company Axial 3D in Belfast on Friday evening.\n\nThe prime minister last visited Northern Ireland in August - his first trip since power sharing was restored in January 2020 after a three-year hiatus.\n\nOn that trip, he held talks with Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill at Hillsborough Castle and also addressed criticism of plans to celebrate Northern Ireland's centenary.\n\nBefore his visit on Friday, Mr Johnson announced official events to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said the events would reflect on what made Northern Ireland \"the great place it is today\".",

However, there was still a cut of 6% in total payouts made by insurers, to \u00a38.3bn.\n\nMotorists may have hoped to see these savings reflected in lower premiums. The cost of new comprehensive motor insurance did fall to a four-year low, but only dropped by 1%.\n\nThe ABI said this was the result of various factors, some - but not all - of which were the result of the impact of the pandemic.\n\nIt said that some insurers had been altering existing policyholders' deals owing to their lower mileage, which had included offering rebates.\n\nExtra services had also been included, without charge, such as automatic cover for those driving to and from work, or delivering medicines or groceries. Drivers who are financially stretched have also been given the option to pay premiums in instalments.\n\nThere is no guarantee that prices will get any cheaper in the future, despite new controls on whiplash claims.\n\n\"As we edge back to some form of normality, cost pressures remain, such as increasing vehicle repair costs, reflecting ever more complex vehicle technology,\" said Laura Hughes, the ABI's general insurance manager.",

            "section": "Scotland politics",
            "content": "The law aims to give protection for individuals around their sexuality and gender identity, among other protected characteristics\n\nThe legislation consolidates existing law and extends protection for vulnerable groups with a new offence of \"stirring up hatred\".\n\nIt was passed by 82 votes to 32 a day later than expected, after MSPs ran out of time on Wednesday while debating a raft of amendments.\n\nOpponents of the bill said they still have concerns about a possible chilling of free speech.\n\nThere were four abstentions.\n\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: \"I am delighted Holyrood has backed this powerful legislation that is fitting for the Scotland we live in.\n\n\"Parliament has sent a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill was first introduced last April in response to an independent review of Scotland's hate crime laws by Lord Bracadale, but has sparked fierce debate.\n\nUnder the bill, offences are considered \"aggravated\" - which could influence sentencing - if they involve prejudice on the basis of age, disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or variations in sex characteristics (sometimes described as \"intersex\" physical or biological characteristics).\n\nIt also creates new offences of \"stirring up hatred\" - which previously applied only to race - and abolishes the offence of blasphemy which has not been prosecuted in Scotland for more than 175 years.\n\nAn earlier draft of the bill was criticised by the Law Society of Scotland for having a perceived low threshold for prosecution.\n\nA number of groups including religious and cultural groups, writers, journalists, campaigners and police raised concerns about its impact on free expression.\n\nThe Scottish government responded by modifying the wording and strengthening freedom of expression provisions.\n\nThe changes meant \"stirring up hatred\" would only be considered an offence if it was intentional.\n\nOn Wednesday, two amendments designed to further strengthen the protection of free speech were passed unanimously by MSPs.\n\nDuring the final debate on Thursday, Humza Yousaf argued that those provisions were strong enough to prevent criminalisation.\n\nHe said: \"To those who think they may accidentally somehow fall foul of the law... because they believe sex is immutable, or they believe an adult man cannot become a female or they campaign for the rights of Palestinians... or those that proselytise that same-sex relationships are sinful, none of these people would fall foul of the stirring up of hatred offence for solely stating their belief - even if they did so in a robust manner.\n\n\"Why? Because solely stating any belief, which I accept may be offensive to some, is not breaching the criminal threshold.\n\n\"This bill makes clear that we are listening to the victims of hate crime.\"\n\nIt was described in a heated five-hour debate as \"the most controversial\" piece of legislation ever considered by the Scottish Parliament.\n\nFrom its troubled beginnings, the Hate Crime Bill has been altered significantly. Changes were made during cross-party efforts in what some MSPs described as \"Holyrood at its best\".\n\nYet even with that scrutiny, concerns remain. Offences can now be committed even in private, an abandonment of an earlier \"dwelling defence\" in race hate law.\n\nEven with the Scottish government's insistence that the bar for prosecution is high, there are those who still believe this is an example of interference in private and family life. Why should any government, they ask, decide what can and can't be said in the privacy of one's home?\n\nWhat is the difference, though, if one intends to encourage others into action against a vulnerable section of the community, whether that encouragement is in public or in private? That's the position of the Scottish government.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of sex. Some - including Labour's Johann Lamont - say the bill should have done more to protect women. She referred to the violence and abuse women suffer at the hands of men.\n\nThis debate goes to the heart of how individuals identify themselves and asks how the authorities might permit them to discuss their place in society. MSPs have found themselves trying to strike a delicate balance between freedom of expression and freedom from persecution. Have they succeeded? Opinions vary.\n\nSo, having said all that, what does all this actually mean for you? Well, it depends on who YOU are and - crucially - how you're defined by this new law.\n\nHowever, Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said there was \"inherent ambiguity\" in the language of the legislation.\n\nHe claimed it did not strike the right \"balance\" between free expression and protection from hate.\n\nAnother amendment from MSP Johann Lamont that would have included women as a protected group under the legislation was defeated.\n\nThe government has instead set a working group to look at whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime.\n\nThis group, led by QC Baroness Helena Kennedy, is due to report within a year.\n\nScottish Labour's Neil Bibby agreed with Ms Lamont that the legislation was \"flawed\" because sex was not included as a protected characteristic.\n\nHowever he said we \"ultimately have to recognise this bill will give protection to minorities\".\n\nHe said: \"It makes sense that we should seek to consolidate, modernise and reform Scotland's hate crime laws. We need this bill because hate crime has become more widespread. Society has become more polarised and divided.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur also said he thought it was \"anomalous\" to leave out sex as a protected characteristic.\n\nHe said his concerns had \"not wholly disappeared\" but he had been \"persuaded on balance\" to vote for the bill.\n\nMSP John Finnie from the Greens dismissed suggestions from opponents that family dinners could be \"ruined by a flurry of arrests\" if people made controversial comments.\n\nHe said: \"The bill, like others, is about balance, and I think the balance between the freedom of expression and the right to private life has been struck by this bill, and countless organisations agree.\"",

            "content": "The singer's hits include I Can't Feel My Face, Starboy and Blinding Lights\n\nThe Weeknd has said he will boycott future Grammy Awards after being snubbed in this year's nominations.\n\nThe Canadian pop star, whose single Blinding Lights was the biggest-seller in the world last year, was not shortlisted for a single award.\n\nHe later called the lack of recognition \"an attack\".\n\nIn a new statement ahead of Sunday's ceremony, the singer said: \"I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.\"\n\nHe said he would remain absent from the event until the Recording Academy, which organises the awards, got rid of the \"secret committees\" that decide many of the nominations.\n\nThe Grammys voting procedures are notoriously opaque, with review committees having the final say in 72 of the 83 categories.\n\nThe anonymous panels, which can include musicians, record label staff and experts, review the initial choices of the Grammy voters and have the final say over who makes the shortlist.\n\nOrganisers say they are vital to ensuring the awards are balanced, but many artists are suspicious about a procedure that means votes can be overruled.\n\nEarlier this week, former One Direction star Zayn Malik criticised the \"lack of transparency of the nomination process\", saying the current system \"allows favouritism, racism, and networking politics to influence the voting\".\n\nThe Weeknd isn't the first artist to withdraw. Drake declined to submit his 2018 album More Life for Grammys consideration, while Frank Ocean chose not to participate in 2017.\n\n\"I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated,\" he said. \"I'd rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.\"\n\nResponding to The Weeknd's statement, the Recording Academy's acting chief executive Harvey Mason Jr said the organisation was \"constantly changing\".\n\nHe told the New York Times: \"We're all disappointed when anyone is upset. But I will say that we are constantly evolving. And this year, as in past years, we are going to take a hard look at how to improve our awards process, including the nomination review committees.\"\n\nThe 63rd Grammys will take place in Los Angeles this Sunday, with performances from Harry Styles, Dua Lipa, Taylor Swift, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nBeyonce leads the way with nine nominations, while Taylor Swift is favourite to pick up the coveted album of the year award, for her first lockdown record Folklore.\n\nIf she wins, Swift will become the first woman to scoop the best album prize three times.

            "content": "Scientists from UK Biobank have embarked on a major study to determine Covid-19's long-term health impacts.\n\nUK Biobank is a biomedical database with medical images, genetic data and health information on 500,000 people.\n\nAbout 1,500 people who have had Covid will be scanned again to check how organs are affected by infection.\n\nIts chief scientist, Prof Naomi Allen, said it was the only study able to compare patient data before and after they have had Covid.\n\nProf Allen added: \"We knew at the beginning of the pandemic that Covid-19 was largely a respiratory illness. And now what we also know is that it seems to affect other parts of the body as well - the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and even the brain.\n\n\u201cSo researchers will be able to investigate the direct effects of coronavirus infection on changes in both the structure and the function of these organs.\u201d\n\nThe study will look at people with asymptomatic Covid, and others who had severe disease.\n\nBrain scans will also be carried out to try to aid understanding of long Covid.\n\n\u201cIt will enable researchers to investigate whether the effects of the virus on different organs of the body vary between how severe your infection was in the first place,\u201d explains Prof Allen.\n\nDetailed scans of 1,500 Biobank members who have not been infected will also be recorded.\n\nBrian Shepherd, 71, from Gateshead, is one of those taking part.\n\nIn November he spent five days in hospital after catching Covid.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing was when I got in the ambulance, with my wife standing on the pavement, and you think 'will I ever see her again?'.\"\n\nBut after five days of treatment, Brian was allowed home. He has recovered well, but still has some symptoms.\n\nHe hopes his scans - and those of the other Biobank volunteers - will help us to learn more about the after-effects of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe're all very proud of taking part in it, and feel that our little bit can help somewhere along the line for the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nScience is still in the early stages of understanding the long-term effects of Covid.\n\nResearch has already started to chart its impact. Scientists have discovered scarring on the lungs, inflammation and muscle damage of the heart, and kidney injuries.\n\nThe virus can also affect the brain, and some long Covid sufferers have said they are experiencing \u201cbrain fog\u201d - problems with memory and concentration, dizziness and depression.\n\nThe hope is the study could pinpoint some of the neurological changes that may have taken place.\n\nProf Paul Matthews, a neuroscientist from Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe brain scans can tell us more general things about the brain structure. Whether there's evidence for inflammation in the brain that may be persisting, and whether there's been damage enough to to actually kill nerve cells in the brain that may cause some shrinkage.\u201d\n\nThese scans will be repeated over the coming years - and made available to researchers all around the world.\n\nThe team says our understanding of the health legacy of Covid is just beginning.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

Mr Briggs became unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital at about 16:15.\n\nThe inquest, held in Milton Keynes, was told Acting Sgt Loren Short and PC Geoff Bennett restrained Mr Briggs.\n\nThe officers said they \"wanted to do the best (they) could\" while he was \"shouting, struggling, and kicking out\", but the lawyer for Mr Briggs's family accused them of \"telling a pack of lies\".\n\nWitnesses said they heard Mr Briggs call out \"please help me\" while he was restrained face-down in a \"dangerous position\" on the concrete for more than 13 minutes.\n\nThe jury found that \"inappropriate weight\" was used against him, though police officers did \"reasonably believe\" it was appropriate.\n\nA secondary cause of death was given as coronary heart disease.\n\nMr Briggs was described as \"a really good dad\" who loved spending time with his children\n\nBefore the inquest, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) paramedics who attended the call had admitted a failure to check Mr Briggs's vital signs or take him to hospital in an ambulance for medical treatment.\n\nTwo paramedics who watched him being restrained \"did not even speak to Leon\" or \"offer medical advice to police\", Lewis Andrews, EEAST clinical general manager, told the inquest.\n\nJurors said Mr Briggs had been experiencing psychotic disorder, caused by high usage of amphetamines, resulting in erratic and irrational behaviour and his subsequent detention.\n\nOfficers failed to recognise he was in a state of medical emergency and did not monitor him in the police van and cell, which also contributed to his death, the jury said.\n\nThe jury heard officers were \"laughing\" as Mr Briggs was motionless and lying face down in the cell. Officers later called out his name and asked \"are you all right?\".\n\nIn a statement after the inquest, Mrs Briggs said: \"Why did the police choose to treat my son, who was mixed race, as if his life had no value? They took away his human rights.\n\n\"To this day, those police officers still have their jobs and livelihoods and no one has been punished for Leon's death.\n\n\"There has been no accountability or justice.\"\n\nIn 2018 the CPS said no officers would be charged over Mr Briggs's death.\n\nMrs Briggs said she had \"been truly shocked by the brutality of the treatment\" of her son and \"by how he suffered in his last hour of life\".\n\n\"He committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor - with force used against him - and he was shackled,\" she said.\n\nBedfordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Briggs's loved ones had \"to wait far too long to hear all the facts surrounding his death\".\n\nHe said Mr Briggs \"was suffering a drug-induced psychosis triggered by amphetamine levels described by one expert as being 'off the scale'\".\n\n\"Unbeknown to officers he also had a serious underlying heart condition,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no easy way of managing such a situation.\"\n\nLeon Briggs was detained under the Mental Health Act at Luton police station\n\nPC Peter Baron, who assisted officers during the restraint, told the inquest the way Mr Briggs was moved from the ground to the police van went against the \"approved technique\".\n\nEmma Carter, secretary of Bedfordshire Police Federation, said she disagreed with the jury's conclusion that Mr Briggs was restrained in a dangerous way, and said officers \"did their very best\" to deal with \"a very tragic incident\".\n\nMs Carter added that \"six colleagues were suspended from duty for more than five years as part of this process\".\n\nAt the time misconduct proceedings were dropped against five officers in February 2020, more than \u00a31m of public money had been spent on their pay while they had been suspended.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "content": "Royal Mail is to trial Sunday parcel deliveries for major retailers amid an online shopping boom.\n\nInternet sales were already on the up before the coronavirus crisis, but the pandemic caused huge growth in 2020.\n\nRoyal Mail said the trial would open the door to parcel deliveries seven days a week.\n\nThe postal service has been hit by coronavirus delays, but a spokesperson said it was \"working hard\" to make deliveries.\n\nRoyal Mail said an increasing number of customers were shopping online and expected to get their purchases as soon as possible after placing their orders.\n\nIt said that \"a number of retail brands are trialling the service\" but declined to name them as yet.\n\nRivals such as DPD and Hermes already make Sunday deliveries for major retailers such as Amazon.\n\nNick Landon, chief commercial officer at Royal Mail, said: \"The last year has reset so many customer expectations and the desire for even more convenient and even more frequent parcel deliveries has certainly been one of them.\"\n\nRoyal Mail said it had \"processed unprecedented parcel volumes\" in the past year as non-essential retailers were closed during lockdowns.\n\nHowever, its customers were hit with postal delays over Christmas due to \"exceptional\" volumes of post, while delays continued into the New Year as its workforce was affected by Covid-19.\n\nThe postal service still has advice on its website about delays which says: \"Some areas of the country may experience a reduction in service levels due to higher volumes of mail, the ongoing impact of Covid-related staff absences and necessary social distancing measures at local mail centres and delivery offices.\"\n\nA Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"Our first priority throughout this pandemic has been the safety of our people and our customers.\n\n\"We have worked hard to deliver the most comprehensive service we can, including retaining around 10,000 temporary workers to help us deal with the increased demand.\"\n\nIn addition, Royal Mail is building a second parcel hub in Daventry, which will be larger than its existing hub in Warrington, to meet the growth in demand, it said.\n\n\"Once complete, the new hub will be the size of more than 10 football pitches and have the capacity to process over one million parcels per day, making it the largest Royal Mail parcel hub in the UK,\" the firm said in a statement.\n\nRoyal Mail piloted Sunday parcel deliveries in 2014, but took the decision not to roll out that service.\n\nThe Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"We were early adopters with the 2014 Sunday trial, which was limited to within the M25 area.\n\n\"Since that time, there has been a seismic change in consumers' online behaviours.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said that customers were making more online purchases than ever before and expected deliveries seven days a week.\n\n\"This trial is responding to those changing demands for even higher levels of convenience across the UK,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"With the e-commerce boom continuing through the latest lockdown, online shoppers have come to expect seven-days-a-week delivery as standard.\n\n\"Launching a Sunday delivery service is clearly an attempt to seize the moment and capitalise on the snowballing momentum the group has picked up over the past four months.\n\n\"This week, Royal Mail again upgraded its profits forecasts because of the surge in home deliveries and renaissance of letter writing during the pandemic.\"\n\nHowever, Ms Streeter said that whether it would be a success or not \"is far from signed, sealed and delivered\", adding that there had \"long been under-investment in automation\" in the service.\n\n\"Royal Mail needs to show it has the capacity to meet this unprecedented demand.\"\n\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \"This expansion into Sunday parcel deliveries will certainly be a challenge for Royal Mail which has struggled with the increase in demand during the pandemic, and has been outshone by some of its competitors.\n\nHowever, she said that Royal Mail remained one of the largest couriers in the UK, and the introduction of two parcel hubs in the UK \"shows its commitment to modernising\".\n\n\"Now the long-running dispute over pay and conditions with the union is over, it can focus on investing in its parcels division.\"\n\n\"Although the move may be out of necessity rather than the business being fully prepared, consumer shopping habits have now shifted. Royal Mail needs to stamp its authority and deliver on its commitment or face being bottom of the pile.\"",

            "section": "World",
            "content": "Countries should not stop using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine over fears it causes blood clots as there is no indication this is true, the World Health Organization says.\n\nBulgaria, Denmark and Norway are among the countries that have paused its use.\n\nBut on Friday a WHO spokeswoman said there was no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\n\nMargaret Harris said it was an \"excellent vaccine\" and should continue to be used.\n\nAround 5 million Europeans have already received the AstraZeneca jab.\n\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - or developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered. There were also reports that a 50-year-old man had died in Italy after developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n\nThe WHO is investigating the reports, as it does any safety questions, Ms Harris said.\n\nBut no causal relationship had been established between the shot and the health problems reported, she said.\n\nOn Friday, AstraZeneca said the recorded number of blood clots in vaccinated people was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\n\n\"An analysis of our safety data of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nBulgaria's decision to pause its rollout followed similar steps by Denmark, Iceland and Norway as well as Thailand. Italy and Austria have stopped using certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency, the EU's medicines regulator, said earlier there was no indication the jab was causing the blood clots.\n\nOther countries, including the UK, Germany, Australia and Mexico, have said they are continuing their rollout.\n\nWhile vast numbers of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with other things unrelated to the vaccine.\n\nThese pauses for the AstraZeneca vaccine are not because it is unsafe to give. It's to allow time for experts to explore why a small number of people who were recently give the shot also developed blood clots.\n\nWhen an illness occurs shortly after vaccination, it is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way.\n\nThere is no indication or evidence, however, that the vaccine was linked or responsible.\n\nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring. Europe's drug regulator has also backed the vaccine, saying its benefits are clear. Covid can be deadly and vaccination saves lives.\n\nGermany's Health Minister Jens Spahn said he disagreed with the countries suspending the vaccinations.\n\n\"From what we know so far, the benefit... is far greater than the risk,\" he said.\n\nThe temporary suspensions come as a setback for a European vaccination campaign that has stuttered into life, partly due to delays in delivery of the doses.\n\nIn the latest upset, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz complained that the EU was not distributing coronavirus vaccines fairly among member states - according to population size, as agreed.\n\nHe said some countries were striking side deals with vaccine makers instead of leaving procurement to the European Commission.\n\nThe German health ministry acknowledged in January that Germany had signed a deal for 30 million doses with Pfizer BioNTech in September.\n\nAlso on Friday, the WHO approved Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine. It followed EU approval which was given on Thursday, while regulators in the United States, Canada and South Africa have also backed the drug.\n\nAfter cases declined in recent months, several European countries are now seeing a resurgence of the virus. France, Italy, Poland and Turkey have seen the highest numbers in recent weeks.\n\nThe whole of Italy is braced to enter the country's strictest lockdown measures over the Easter weekend, 3 to 5 April.\n\nUnder rules set to be confirmed by the government, residents will only be allowed to leave home for work, health reasons, essential shopping or emergencies. All non-essential shops will be closed as will bars and restaurants. School lessons must be held online.\n\nThe total number of deaths in Italy rose to 100,000 on Monday - the highest toll in Europe after the UK. Officials say infection rates are rising as new variants of the virus take hold.",

However, I am holding my breath to see what that means.\n\n\"Kemi Badenoch, in her speech the other day, seemed to be leaving the stable door open so the primary form of conversion therapy, in religious settings, could continue to happen.\"\n\nLBGT+ campaigner Peter Tatchell, who has accused the government of \"dithering\" over its pledge, also said he would \"not let up until we see the details and timetable of the new law\".\n\nHe added: \"The ban must protect trans people and apply to religious practices. It is time to stop dithering and get this done.\"\n\nA No 10 source told the BBC there had been no change in government policy since Monday's debate, meaning it is still unclear whether a law to ban the practice will be introduced in Parliament or not.\n\nDuring a visit to Queen's University Belfast, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"I think this practice is repulsive and I think it's abhorrent, and I'm sorry these advisers have gone, but be in no doubt that we will deal with this issue.\n\n\"It is technically complex to deal with but we're determined to take further steps to stamp it out.\"",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Four further cases of the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil have been identified in England, bringing the total in the UK to 10.\n\nThree cases of the P.1 variant are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of the two existing cases in the area.\n\nThe other new case was identified in Bradford.\n\nScientists previously said the variant appears more contagious and there were concerns over its response to vaccines.\n\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said last week it was hoped that vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\n\nThe new Bradford case tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February.\n\nSubsequent genomic sequencing identified the case as the P.1 variant, Public Health England said in a statement.\n\nThousands of positive Covid cases, from all across the UK, are sent for this further sequencing every week as scientists aim to identify any variants of the virus.\n\nThe new South Gloucestershire cases were uncovered when people were offered testing in response to the initial cases found in the area last month - and those who tested positive had their results sent on for further analysis.\n\nSpecialist contact tracing teams are working to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.\n\nContact-tracers have advised close contacts of the individual in Bradford to isolate and get a test.\n\nThere are now seven cases of the P.1 variant in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.\n\nIt was always known more cases of the P.1 Brazil variant were coming.\n\nWhen it was confirmed 11 days ago the variant was here, it was known two household members of the original South Gloucestershire cases had tested positive for Covid.\n\nThe results of the genomic sequencing to check which variant they had was not yet complete, but the expectation was it would be P.1.\n\nWhere does this leave us? A quarter of all Covid cases are being checked for variants and all the indications are that they are not spreading.\n\nThe new P.1 cases brings the total to 10, while there have been just over 300 cases of the South African variant and another 113 cases where the UK virus has acquired the E484 mutation which allows it to escape some of the immune response.\n\nThere will be more variants out there that have not been detected, but given that overall week-on-week Covid infection levels are lower we can be confident the variant is not taking hold.\n\nMonitoring this though is crucial to help the UK decide if vaccines updates are needed ahead of next winter.\n\nSeparately, Public Health England said a new variant identified in the UK was designated a \"variant under investigation\" on 4 March. It is not known where this variant first emerged.*\n\nIt said the variant - known as VUI-202103/01 - contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with so-called \"variants of concern\".\n\nBut it added that \"it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a [variant of concern]\".\n\nNo additional cases have yet been found.\n\nIn other developments, rough sleepers and other homeless people in England will be prioritised to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\n\nIt comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people who are homeless or sleeping rough were likely to have underlying health conditions and should be offered jabs alongside those in priority group six - people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.\n\nThey should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration, the JCVI added.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the UK has risen compared with recent days, after a further 6,753 cases were reported, according to the latest data.\n\nAnother 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded.\n\nAs of 10 March, some 23,053,716 people had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 1,351,515 had received a second dose.\n\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released in February. Three cases were initially found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\n\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London.\n\nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\n\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - prompted intensive tracing efforts in the region as the identity of the person was initially unknown as he or she failed to register their test properly.\n\nBut that person was found at the end of last week and it was confirmed that he or she had \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission.\n\nUnder current Covid restrictions, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK or abroad. Anyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education or work, and journeys within England are only allowed for limited reasons.\n\nThere are also travel bans on 33 countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\", including Brazil and other South American nations.\n\nHowever, the ban on travellers from South America came into effect on 15 February, after one case of the Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. The latest Bradford case is also a person known to have travelled from Brazil via Paris just before that change came in.\n\n*This story has now been updated to reflect new information on UK variants on the Public Health England website. PHE previously reported two cases of the VUI-202103/01 variant had been found in the south-east of England in individuals who had recently been in Antigua. PHE now says: \"Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.\"",

Being a tourist town, without tourists businesses just can survive. I dread to know what Llandudno is going to look like when all of this is over.\"",

            "content": "The Duke of Cambridge has said the royals are \"very much not a racist family\" in his first comments after accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a TV interview.\n\nPrince William also said he had not yet spoken to his brother but would do so.\n\nMeghan and Prince Harry said a royal had expressed concern over \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\n\nBuckingham Palace previously said the claim was \"concerning\" but it would be addressed privately.\n\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but that the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\n\nDuring a visit to a school in Stratford, east London, on Thursday, Prince William was asked by a reporter: \"Is the Royal Family a racist family, sir?\"\n\nThe duke replied: \"We're very much not a racist family.\"\n\nAsked whether he had spoken to Prince Harry since the Oprah interview, Prince William said: \"No, I haven't spoken to him yet but I will do.\"\n\nPrince William's visit is not the first appearance by a senior royal since the interview aired - the Prince of Wales carried out an engagement earlier this week.\n\nDespite Prince William's team making clear to reporters he wouldn't be answering questions, he must have known they might come. One wonders if he had planned to engage or whether the answers were impromptu.\n\nWilliam will be well aware that anything he utters will be headline news.\n\nThe first question alluded to the rift between the two brothers. In the Oprah interview, Prince Harry said their relationship is \"space\" at the moment but that \"time heals all things hopefully\".\n\nWe don't know when they last spoke but we do now know that William does intend to speak to him.\n\nAs for the second and more direct question - \"Is the royal family a racist family, sir?\" - William could have ignored it. But, despite the Queen's statement saying the race issue would be dealt with privately, the prince clearly felt he had to push back on what has become a very public and damaging allegation.\n\nRemaining silent, he felt, was not the best option.\n\nIn the TV interview, Meghan told Oprah there were \"concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie's] skin might be when he was born\".\n\nBoth Prince Harry and Meghan refused to say who made the comment - but Harry later clarified to Oprah that it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nDuring the interview Harry also said it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles.\n\nAnd asked by Oprah if the couple left the UK because of racism from the tabloid media, Harry replied: \"It was a large part of it.\"\n\nIn the interview, Harry also spoke about his relationship with his family - especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother Prince William.\n\nAt one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\".\n\nAnd of William, Harry said: \"The relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace issued a response to the interview earlier this week following crisis meetings involving senior royals.\n\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\n\nThe fallout from the interview has also seen broadcaster Piers Morgan leave his role as host of Good Morning Britain, after his comments about Meghan attracted 41,000 complaints.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Society of Editors - an industry body for the UK press - resigned after a row over its reaction to Harry's comments about the tabloid media.",

            "content": "Osbourne and Morgan were both judges on America's Got Talent\n\nSharon Osbourne has issued an apology for comments she made about racism while defending Piers Morgan on her US chat show The Talk.\n\nThe star was one of the first people to voice support for Morgan after he left Good Morning Britain over his criticism of Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nOn Wednesday, she angrily challenged her Talk co-host Sheryl Underwood to identify when Morgan had been racist.\n\nBut she has now said she \"panicked, felt blindsided [and] got defensive\".\n\nOsbourne's statement followed criticism on social media that she had appeared to belittle a black woman's experiences of, and perspective on, racism.\n\nIn Friday's statement, she apologised to \"anyone of colour that I offended and/or to anyone that feels confused, or let down by what I said\". She explained that she had \"allowed my fear and horror of being accused of being racist take over\".\n\nMorgan himself was not impressed. \"Sharon's been shamed and bullied into apologising for defending me against colleagues accusing me of racism because I don't believe Meghan Markle,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"I demand an apology from those @TheTalkCBS bullies for their disgraceful slurs against ME.\"\n\nThe row began when Osbourne spoke in defence of Morgan, her former colleague on America's Got Talent, after he left Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.\n\n\"@piersmorgan I am with you. I stand by you,\" she tweeted. \"People forget that you're paid for your opinion and that you're just speaking your truth.\"\n\nWhen Underwood raised the tweet with her on Wednesday's episode of The Talk, Osbourne said: \"I feel like I'm about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is racist, so that makes me a racist.\"\n\n\"For me at 68 years of age to have to turn around and say, 'I ain't racist', what's it got to do with me? How can I be racist about anybody\u2026 or anything in my life?\"\n\nAs she grew increasingly frustrated, her language was bleeped out and Underwood took the programme to a commercial break.\n\nWhen they returned, Osbourne tearfully asked Underwood in a raised voice: \"I will ask you again Sheryl... And don't try and cry because if anyone should be crying, it should be me... Where you have heard him say racist things? Educate me. Tell me.\"\n\nUnderwood replied: \"It is not the exact words of racism, it's the implication and the reaction to it.\n\n\"To not want to address that because she is a black woman, and to try to dismiss it or to make it seem less than what it is, that's what makes it racist.\"\n\nShe added that Osbourne was her friend, and she didn't think of her as racist.\n\n\"I think it's too late, I think that seed's already sown,\" Osbourne said.\n\nThe clip circulated widely on social media. \"This is Sharon Osbourne, telling a black woman not to cry and demanding a definition of racism, as she sobs over Piers Morgan who walked off his job bc [because] a mixed black coworker calmly challenged his fixation on Meghan Markle,\" comedian Rae Sanni wrote.\n\n\"No one should be surprised by Sharon Osbourne's behaviour,\" added pop culture commentator Shar Joseell. \"She has been consistently loud in her willful stupidity (about race) throughout the years.\n\n\"The public gaslighting might be a new lil twist tho.\"\n\nIn her lengthy apology, Osbourne referred to her original tweet about Morgan, saying: \"Please hear me when I say I do not condone racism, misogyny or bullying. I should have always have been more specific about that in my tweet.\n\n\"I will always support freedom of speech, but now I see how I unintentionally didn't make that clear distinction.\n\n\"I hope we can collectively continue to learn from each other and from ourselves so we can all continue to pave the way for much-needed growth and change.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter\n\nSeparately, Morgan thanked the 200,000 people who have signed a petition calling for his return to Good Morning Britain, but said he wouldn't be coming back.\n\n\"Normally, people start petitions to have me fired or deported, so this is a pleasant surprise,\" he said.\n\nHis former co-presenter Alex Beresford, whose on-air criticism caused Morgan to storm off the show hours before he announced his permanent departure on Tuesday, has also addressed the matter for the first time.\n\n\"I didn't want him to quit, but I did want him to listen,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Over the last few years, Piers and I have had a lively, cheeky on-air relationship.\n\n\"We both wanted to be on the show on Tuesday morning, and, from our very public conversations on Twitter, we both knew how strongly our opinions differed on the treatment of Harry and Meghan pre and post the interview that has split the world.\n\n\"I hoped we could reach a place of understanding. It's sad that we weren't able to get there, but challenging his opinion was not an outrage. On this occasion, we have to agree to disagree.\"\n\nHe concluded by praising the presenter: \"Personally, Piers has always supported my growth. He's given me advice on several occasions and for that I am grateful. I wish him well.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government.\n\nThe charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed.\n\nThe report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD.\n\nDespite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied.\n\nPrior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called for her permanent release so she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK.\n\nThe report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence.\n\nThe Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday.\n\nNeither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC.\n\nIn the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing.\n\nAccording to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to \"extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran\" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\n\nWhilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online.\n\n\"The interrogations were traumatising,\" she is quoted as saying in the report. \"They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service.\n\n\"They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job.\"\n\nShe says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day.\n\n\"The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,\" she says. \"There were times I could not breathe.\"\n\nShe was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time.\n\nMr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: \"This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away.\n\n\"She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people.\"\n\nThe two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals.\n\nMr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's \"need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands\".\n\nHe adds: \"And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands.\"\n\nHer interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors.\n\n\"I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,\" she reported.\n\nShe told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter.\n\n\"It was unbearable,\" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. \"I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me.\"\n\nRichard Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since 2016\n\nIn July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands.\n\nHer incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment.\n\nThe report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives.\n\n\"She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,\" the report says.\n\n\"She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband.\"\n\nDr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group.\n\nShe described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a \"remarkably resilient woman\" who was \"trying to keep hope, trying to be strong\" during her evaluation.\n\nBut she said: \"Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty.\"\n\nShe may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats.\n\nConcern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report.\n\nThe doctors say it is \"possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury\" in her right hand.\n\nAnd even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery.\n\nShe will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms.\n\n\"Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,\" it concludes. \"In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment.\"\n\nBut it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK.\n\n\"The threat of a second trial remains very real,\" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative.\n\n\"This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family.\"\n\nHer treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture.\n\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.\"",

We're now up to about 30%, and I'm confident by the end of the year that we'll get to 50%.\n\n\"I will be prioritising the hardest-to-reach places, and we will be setting out a broadband action plan in about a month or so.\"\n\nSir Tim's letter, written with the co-founder of the Web Foundation Rosemary Leith, calls for a global push to connect young people.\n\nIt quotes a figure of $428bn (\u00a3306bn), which the Alliance for Affordable Internet initiative says would need to be invested by governments and the private sector to achieve this aim by 2030.\n\nBut, the letter says, this would deliver huge economic benefits for the developing world and concludes \"we cannot afford not to do it\".\n\nSir Tim also expresses concern about misinformation and abuse on the web, particularly that aimed at young women.\n\nBut he says the pandemic has offered the opportunity to think again about improving his creation for everyone.\n\n\"There's a very positive energy about people fixing things, and building a better world,\" he says.",

            "content": "Rules on meeting people outdoors in Scotland have been relaxed.\n\nUp to four adults from two different households are now able to meet in any outdoor space, including in private gardens - an increase from two adults from two households.\n\nRestrictions on young people have also been eased, with four people aged between 12 and 17 able to meet even if they are all from different households.\n\nOutdoor non-contact group sports for people aged over 12 can resume.\n\nIt has also been confirmed that children under the age of the 12 will now be able to start outdoor contact sports such as football and rugby.\n\nUnder-18s can also travel across local authority boundaries to attend a club.\n\nFriday marked the first anniversary of the first confirmed Covid death in Scotland. A UK-wide minute's silence will be held on 23 March, the anniversary of the first lockdown.\n\nProminent buildings and landmarks throughout the UK will be illuminated to mark the anniversary, with the Kelpies, Wallace Monument and Ness Bridge among those in Scotland.\n\nThe government's previous plan for easing lockdown said that allowing four people from two households to meet outdoors was unlikely to happen before 15 March.\n\nBut First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the \"modest\" easing that came into force on Friday was the result of the progress the country was making in suppressing the virus.\n\nPeople should only go into someone's else's home if it is essential to reach a back garden, or to use the toilet.\n\nAnd the overall requirement to stay at home remains in place, except for specific purposes.\n\nThe latest statistics showed that a further 682 people have tested positive for the virus, taking the total number of confirmed cases since the pandemic began to 208,429.\n\nThe deaths of a further 17 people who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded, bringing the total by that measure to 7,500.\n\nBut National Records of Scotland figures released earlier this week showed that the total number of deaths from confirmed or suspected cases of the virus is now well over 9,000.\n\nThere are 512 patients in hospital with a confirmed case of the virus, a decrease of 13 on the previous day, while the number of Covid patients in intensive care units has fallen by two to 38.\n\nThe number of people who have received their first vaccine dose has increased by 18,836 since Thursday, and now stands at 1,844,636 - with 149,409 having received their second dose.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives' leader Douglas Ross said the new easing measures showed that \"the government got it wrong originally\" and that the \"overly-cautious approach\" was not matched by the data.\n\nMr Ross said all pupils should be returning full-time from Monday rather the current plan, which will see some secondary pupils have less than two hours a week in the classroom.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown had to be the last one.\n\nHe added: \"We have got to get the vaccination programme right and strengthen our testing and tracing systems.\n\n\"The virus is still not going away and we are only using around a third of our testing capacity every day.\"\n\nEarlier this week Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that new cases of the virus, the number of people being admitted to hospital and deaths were all \"still higher than we would want\".\n\nHowever, she said there was a clear \"positive trend\" in figures, alongside \"excellent progress with the vaccination programme\".\n\nAlthough the number of vaccines being administered each day has has fallen in recent weeks, the first minister said supplies would soon increase to \"allow for a very significant acceleration\" of the programme.\n\nThe Scottish government has been considering accelerating its exit plan out of lockdown, which currently says that the country will return to a levels system towards the end of April.\n\nIt emerged earlier this month that new rules are set to make it harder for areas to drop down to lower tiers of these restrictions.\n\nIt is also expected that non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers will reopen as part of the levels system.\n\nBut business leaders have said a return to this framework would be \"devastating\" and have called for more clarity on how the system would work.\n\nHow will you be affected by the relaxation of restrictions in Scotland?

The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data.\n\nThe security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system, which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide.\n\nThe NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue.\n\nInitially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data.\n\nBut after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw.\n\nThe result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack.\n\n\"We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,\" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned.\n\n\"While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates.\"\n\nHe also urged all organisations to \"familiarise\" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised.\n\nThe true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone.\n\nWhat is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact.\n\nWhile many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low.\n\nThat may change in the coming days as more reports come in.\n\nWhat is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.",

or R-number - for the community in Northern Ireland is \"consistently below one\", said the first minister.\n\nShe said she hoped that the drop in figures meant that the executive would be able to make more announcements next week about easing other restrictions.\n\nMs O'Neill said there would be \"no major shifts\" before Easter but that the executive wanted to allow people time to plan for the coming weeks and months.\n\nMrs Foster also said she recognised that people were facing into a second year with many being unable to spend Mother's Day with their loved ones.\n\nArlene Foster says people should celebrate Mother's Day within their own household\n\n\"Many of us will be relying on cards and phone calls to carry out our love and appreciation,\" she said.\n\nShe also urged anyone wanting to celebrate Mother's Day or St Patrick's Day to do so with their own household.\n\nMs O'Neill said Northern Ireland was \"on the cusp of brighter days\" but warned that going to parties or gathering in groups posed a \"serious risk to a fragile situation\".\n\nMeanwhile, Stormont ministers have also agreed additional funding to support businesses and jobs during the pandemic.\n\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy had proposed extending rates relief for another 12 months for almost 30,000 businesses, in a package worth \u00a3230m.\n\nHis plan means that for the second year running businesses in the following sectors will not pay any rates:\n\nThe executive also announced a Covid-19 support scheme for travel agents experiencing difficulties as a result of the pandemic, worth \u00a31.175m.\n\nIt includes a flat payment of \u00a310,000 to travel agency businesses operating from commercial premises or a \u00a33,500 payment to self-employed travel agents working from home.\n\nThe scheme will open next Friday for a limited time until 26 March.",

            "content": "The rate of twins born worldwide has gone up by a third since the 1980s\n\nMore twins are being born than ever before but the world may now have reached peak twin, researchers say.\n\nAbout 1.6 million twins are born each year worldwide, with one in every 42 children born a twin.\n\nDelayed childbearing and medical techniques such as IVF have seen the rate of twin births rise by a third since the 1980s.\n\nBut it could be all downhill from here as the focus shifts to one baby per pregnancy, which is less risky.\n\nAccording to a global overview in the journal Human Reproduction, the peak was reached because of large increases in twinning rates in all regions over 30 years - from a 32% rise in Asia to a 71% rise in North America.\n\nThe researchers collected information on twinning rates from 165 countries for 2010 to 2015, and compared them with rates for 1980 to 1985.\n\nThe number of twins born per thousand deliveries is now particularly high in Europe and North America - and worldwide it's gone from nine per 1,000 deliveries to 12.\n\nBut twin rates in Africa have always been high and haven't changed much over the past 30 years, which could be due to population growth.\n\nAfrica and Asia make up about 80% of all twin deliveries in the world at present.\n\nProf Christiaan Monden, the study's author from the University of Oxford, said there was a reason for that.\n\n\"The twinning rate in Africa is so high because of the high number of dizygotic twins - twins born from two separate eggs - born there,\" he said.\n\n\"This is most likely to be due to genetic differences between the African population and other populations.\"\n\nTwinning rates in Europe, North America and Oceanic countries have been catching up - and the increasing use of medically assisted reproduction since the 1970s - for example IVF, ICSI, artificial insemination and ovarian stimulation - have been the main reason.\n\nGiving birth to twins is riskier for the mother and the babies\n\nThese techniques all increase the likelihood of a multiple birth.\n\nWomen choosing to start families later in life, increased use of contraception and lower fertility overall also play a role, the review says.\n\nBut the emphasis is now on singleton pregnancies, which are safer, says Prof Monden.\n\n\"This is important as twin deliveries are associated with higher death rates among babies and children, and more complications for mothers and children during pregnancy, and during and after delivery,\" he says.\n\nTwins have more complications at birth, are more often born premature and have lower birth weights and higher still birth rates.\n\nThe review found that the fate of twins in low and middle-income countries was more of a concern.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, many twins will lose their co-twin in their first year of life - more than 200,000 each year.\n\n\"While twinning rates in many rich Western countries are now getting close to those in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge difference in the survival chances,\" said Prof Jeroen Smits, a study author.\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers say India and China will play a major role in future twinning rates.\n\nDeclining fertility, older mothers at birth and techniques like IVF will all have a bearing on the numbers of twins in years to come.",
