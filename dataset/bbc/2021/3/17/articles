            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "A government scheme to house rough sleepers during the pandemic \"exposed the scale\" of the issue, say MPs.\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee praised the Everyone In initiative, brought in due to Covid, which took over 37,000 people off the streets by January 2021.\n\nBut they said the number was nearly nine times official estimates of rough sleepers, showing a \"much larger\" issue than the government had \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe government said it had \"ambitious plans\" to end rough sleeping.\n\nHowever, the committee expressed concern that the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government \"still does not have a plan\" to achieve this commitment.\n\nIn January, the National Audit Office called on the government to review its rough sleeping strategy in light of the figures from Everyone In, claiming it was \"out of step\" with the problem.\n\nEveryone In was an emergency scheme launched in March 2020 as the pandemic hit the country.\n\nIt saw local councils in England given an initial share of \u00a33.2m to provide accommodation for rough sleepers, often in hotels or hostels.\n\nOverall, councils in England have received over \u00a3700m to help tackle homelessness during 2020-21, including providing accommodation for rough sleepers.\n\nThe Everyone In programme received widespread praise for helping the vulnerable group and protecting them from coronavirus - with the committee saying it helped avert more than 20,000 infections.\n\nBut the group of MPs said it also showed how serious a problem rough sleeping was in the country.\n\nThe latest official estimate from the government of the number of people sleeping rough was 2,688, down from 4,266 in autumn 2019.\n\nBut the figure is based on a snapshot survey where councils in England either count rough sleepers on one night each year between 1 October and 30 November or give an estimate based on information from \"local agencies\", often charities.\n\nThe number also does not include people in night shelters or assessment centres, and could miss people sleeping hidden from view.\n\nThe estimate was far outstripped by the number of homeless people given accommodation through the Everyone In scheme over the course of the crisis, which hit 37,430 in January.\n\nAhead of the 2019 election, the Conservative Party pledged to end rough sleeping in England by the end of the Parliament in 2024.\n\nBut with the reality of the situation laid bare, the committee is concerned whether that target will be met, claiming a plan is not yet in place.\n\nLabour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said: \"Everyone In was a success with local authorities and voluntary organisations working to help people living on the street into hostels and hotel rooms in a matter of days.\n\n\"But the Everyone In initiative has exposed the scale of the task the Ministry of Housing faces to meet the government's commitment to end rough sleeping in three years.\"\n\nThe committee also questioned whether a government target to provide 3,300 homes for people sleeping rough by the end of March 2021 would be reached, accusing it of \"disappointing evasiveness\" around the plan.\n\nAnd it raised concerns over long term funding of local authorities, especially giving them permission to help people with no recourse to public funds - a term used for some immigrants who are not entitled to certain government benefits.\n\nMs Hillier added: \"Rough sleeping was a massive public health issue long before the pandemic, and much larger than government has previously publicly acknowledged.\n\n\"[The ministry] now has a huge opportunity to capitalise on this success in the pandemic response and begin to reverse its long record of failed and abandoned housing targets and policies.\n\n\"People without recourse to public funds are still left exposed and risk losing support. Support for these people is urgent.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the government said it rejected the \"unfounded criticisms in this report\" arguing that the committee \"misuses different data to provide an inaccurate picture\".\n\nShe added that the government was providing \"over \u00a3700m this year and \u00a3750m next year\" to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "Mars: Vast amount of water may be locked up on planet\n\nThe Curiosity rover has found extensive evidence of hydrated minerals at Mars' Gale Crater\n\nIt's a longstanding mystery: how Mars lost the water that flowed across its surface billions of years ago.\n\nScientists now think they have an answer: much of it became trapped in the planet's outer layer - its crust.\n\nThe ancient water exists in the form of minerals contained within Martian rocks.\n\nThe findings have been discussed at the 52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference and are published in Science journal.\n\nThe study used measurements gathered from Mars-orbiting spacecraft, rovers and meteorites.\n\nResearchers then developed a computer simulation of how water was lost from the planet over time.\n\nMore than four billion years ago, Mars was warmer and wetter - possibly with a thicker atmosphere. Water coursed through rivers, cutting channels in the rock, and pooled in impact craters.\n\nThe Red Planet could have held enough water to cover its entire surface in a layer measuring between 100m and one kilometre deep.\n\nAround a billion years later, Mars had made the transition to the colder, desolate planet we recognise today.\n\n\"We have known for a long time that Mars was much wetter in its early history. But, the exact fate of that water has been an ongoing problem,\" said planetary scientist Dr Peter Grindrod, who was not involved with the latest study.\n\nDr Grindrod, from London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News: \"We already know from studies of the atmosphere of Mars that some of that water was lost to space, and ice deposits on and just below the surface tell us that some water became frozen.\"\n\nEarth has a magnetic shield, or magnetosphere, that helps prevent the atmosphere from escaping. But Mars' magnetic shield is weak and could have allowed elemental components of water to escape from the planet.\n\nBut the rate at which hydrogen - one chemical constituent of water - escapes from that atmosphere today suggests this can't be the whole story.\n\nIf it's assumed that the current loss rate for hydrogen was the same in the past, \"it's a pretty small amount of water that you would have lost through this escape process\", said co-author Eva Linghan Scheller, from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena.\n\nIn other words, most of the water must have gone elsewhere.\n\nNasa's latest rover will explore a geological feature called a delta, laid down in the presence of flowing water\n\nThe results of the team's computer modelling work show that between 30% and 99% of Mars' initial water was incorporated into minerals and buried in the planet's crust.\n\nCo-author Prof Bethany Ehlmann, also from from Caltech, explained that, \"by studying data from Mars missions, It became clear that it was common - and not rare - to find evidence of water alteration\".\n\nShe continued: \"When the crust becomes altered, it takes water - like liquid water - and sequesters it in a hydrated mineral that has water in its structure so that it is effectively trapped.\"\n\nThe authors suggest that most of the water was lost between about 4.1 and 3.7 billion years ago - during a stretch of Martian history known as the Noachian Period.\n\nDr Michael Meyer, lead scientist for Nasa's Mars exploration program, said: \"The original overarching role of Mars exploration has been to follow the water, since it plays such a central role in the geology, climate and life of the planet.\n\n\"This is a very important paper to understand how much water was on Mars, how it might have been lost and where it might be today.\"\n\nDr Grindrod added: \"What this new study tells us is that a lot of that water, possibly the majority, could have actually been locked into the rocks on Mars. This process of hydration is capable of storing large volumes of water, up to an amount equivalent to a global layer a kilometre deep.\"\n\n\"Although most of the liquid water had probably disappeared after about one and a half billion years after Mars formed, we see evidence of hydrated minerals at the surface today, in areas like Jezero Crater, which is currently being explored by the Perseverance rover.\n\n\"The early climate of Mars remains one of the most important topics in planetary science, and this study will help our understanding of the processes responsible for water loss.\"",

            "content": "Sharon Osbourne has said she may not be wanted back, or want to go back, on US chat show The Talk after clashing with one of her co-hosts about Piers Morgan.\n\nShe said she had \"got too personal\" with co-presenter Sheryl Underwood and that she feared the row had escalated too far for her to return to the show.\n\nThe Talk has been taken off air and has extended its hiatus until next week.\n\nMeanwhile, Osbourne's spokesman has dismissed accusations of racism made against her as \"lies\".\n\nThe row on The Talk followed Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Morgan's subsequent departure from Good Morning Britain after saying he \"didn't believe a word\" she had said.\n\nOsbourne was one of the first people to voice support for Morgan, claiming he had the right to express his own opinion.\n\nHer comments were challenged on Wednesday's edition of The Talk, leading to an angry exchange with Underwood.\n\n\"I feel like I'm about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is racist, so that makes me a racist,\" Osborne said.\n\nShe later issued an apology, saying she had \"felt blindsided\" and had let her \"fear and horror of being accused of being racist take over\".\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, Osbourne reiterated her apology and said she should have appreciated that Underwood was \"hurting\".\n\n\"I own up to what I did,\" she told the programme. \"I can't not own up. I said what I said. I got too personal with Sheryl.\"\n\nBut Osbourne also claimed she had been \"set up\" as a \"sacrificial lamb\" and had not been sufficiently prepared by The Talk's producers.\n\n\"I wish we could go on and have a adult conversation calmly and work it out but I don't know whether we can,\" she continued. \"I don't know whether it's gone past that.\n\n\"I would love to, but I don't know whether I even want to go back. I don't know whether I'm wanted there.\"\n\nThe Talk was due to return on Wednesday after US network CBS cancelled its Monday and Tuesday editions. However, the broadcaster has now said the show will not be back until next week while an internal investigation is carried out.\n\nCBS said it was \"committed to a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace\" and was \"very mindful of the important concerns expressed and discussions taking place regarding events on The Talk\".\n\nIts statement said: \"This includes a process where all voices are heard, claims are investigated and appropriate action is taken where necessary. The show will extend its production hiatus until next Tuesday as we continue to review these issues.\"\n\nOsbourne, who is married to rock star Ozzy and has appeared as a judge on The X Factor and other shows, has been a panellist on The Talk throughout its 11 years on air.\n\nFollowing her comments last week, some former colleagues have come forward to make accusations about her.\n\nLast week, former co-presenter Holly Robinson Peete claimed Osbourne had complained she was too \"ghetto\" for the show, and that her job on the presenting line-up ended soon afterwards. Osbourne has denied making those comments or engineering her dismissal.\n\nUS journalist Yashar Ali has since reported allegations that Osbourne made racist remarks about former co-host Julie Chen.\n\nOsbourne's representative Howard Bragman issued a staunch defence. \"The only thing worse than a disgruntled former employee is a disgruntled former talk show host,\" he said.\n\n\"Sharon is disappointed but unfazed and hardly surprised by the lies, the recasting of history and the bitterness coming out at this moment. She will survive this, as she always has.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

            "section": "Wales",
            "content": "Elin Wade had a bad reaction to the creams she was using for eczema\n\nA woman who lost three stone (19kg) and had hallucinations while using topical steroids has called for more support for people reacting to skin treatments.\n\nTeacher Elin Wade, from Swansea, had bad reactions after using creams prescribed for an eczema flare-up.\n\nThe 29-year-old said she was made to feel like a \"fraud\" as topical steroid addiction is not recognised as an official condition by the NHS.\n\nThe Welsh government said serious reactions were \"uncommon\".\n\nAbout 10% of adults and 20% of children in the UK have eczema, with topical steroids considered a safe and effective way in most cases to manage it.\n\nThe creams and ointments come in various strengths, and are usually meant to be used in short courses.\n\nBut some people react badly to the creams, either while using them or when they stop - a condition which has become known as topical steroid addiction.\n\nIn January the British Association of Dermatologists and the National Eczema Society published guidance acknowledging topical steroid withdrawal for the first time.\n\nElin Wade has had mild eczema since childhood, but had a bad flare up in her twenties\n\nIn February 2019, Ms Wade stopped using her steroid creams after she lost weight, had hallucinations and her hair fell out.\n\n\"I went from being a perfectly healthy 25-year-old woman to being a 29-year-old injecting incredibly potent drugs into my system just to get some sort of relief,\" she said.\n\nShe said it was \"exhausting\" and \"frustrating\" trying to tell doctors she believed the creams were driving her symptoms, and that she was made to feel like a \"fraud\".\n\nElin Wade believes it was topical steroid addiction that led to her losing weight\n\n\"It's always been made very clear to me that I should be using topical steroids, that they don't cause addiction, they don't cause withdrawal and it's impossible to get addicted to them,\" she said.\n\n\"It's been so traumatic, the suffering is so intense, there's no way I'd put myself through this if I didn't see other people get better.\"\n\nMs Wade said she had been tested for HIV, lymphoma and leukaemia but she still did not have a diagnosis as the condition is not recognised.\n\n\"It'd just be a lot less stressful because you're suffering so much anyway, just to have somebody acknowledge that this is a condition that actually is happening,\" she added.\n\nEmily Banks described the reaction of doctors as \"disheartening\"\n\nLecturer Emily Banks, 30, from Cardiff, also decided to stop using topical steroids after the ointments she was prescribed stopped working.\n\nDesperate to find answers about why her skin was so bad, she made a \"cry for help\" on social media, sharing photos of her skin.\n\nShe said being disbelieved by doctors was \"really disheartening when you're in pain and you just want help\".\n\nGeorge Moncrieff, a GP in Oxfordshire, said he \"couldn't imagine practicing medicine\" without topical steroids.\n\nThe former chairman of the Dermatology Council of England believes they are so integral to the treatment of skin conditions, sometimes the medical community \"don't want to hear bad news\" about adverse reactions to them.\n\nDr Moncrieff said because some patients were reluctant to use topical steroids in the first place - so-called \"steroid-phobia\" - doctors can sometimes assume people with genuine concerns about bad reactions to steroid creams could be ignored.\n\n\"If doctors think something's uncommon they don't recognise it and they don't discuss it. It's therefore never diagnosed and it continues to be assumed to be uncommon,\" he added.\n\nResearch suggests the average medical school offers about two weeks of dermatology training during six years of study, while nine out of 10 patients with skin issues were not seen by a skin specialist.\n\nJulie Keeley from the Welsh council of the Royal College of GPs said patients should not be afraid to consult their doctor if they were worried they had signs of the condition, and to ask for the second opinion of a dermatology specialist if necessary.\n\nBut she also said GPs needed more specialist training on skin so they could distinguish the signs between normal skin conditions that will respond to steroid creams, and topical steroid addiction.\n\n\"I think it's a good way forward to have more education for dermatology based in Wales and more readily available to healthcare professionals,\" she added.\n\n\"And also integrating it more into the medical school curriculum so people have a better awareness of these conditions.\"\n\nThe author of the new guidance, Celia Moss, said labels like \"topical steroid addiction\" and \"red skin syndrome\" were not helpful for doctors because they are not recognised medical terms.\n\nHer work breaks down topical steroid withdrawal into recognisable and treatable diagnoses for doctors.\n\nShe said she hoped it would go some way to ending the \"friction\" and \"open up channels of communication\" between doctors and patients.\n\nDr Moss also wants to see better labelling of steroid creams so doctors and patients understand how strong they are and how they should be used.\n\nThe Welsh government said topical steroids played an important role in the treatment of some conditions, but longer-term use should be monitored carefully.\n\n\"More significant reactions following withdrawal of topical steroids are relatively uncommon, however anyone concerned about side effects should discuss this with their doctor,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

I came in on the Christmas weekend, our biggest weekend, they had taken every single item.\n\n\"I had to run around to all my friends and borrow dryers, scissors, just to be able to work that day.\n\n\"I was really very, very upset, but also angry. How dare they? I worked really hard all my life to have this, just for someone to come in and take it.\"\n\nMs Titmus said it had happened so many times she no longer made claims on her insurance because of the increase it would mean to her premium.\n\n\"Other times they've cost me \u00a3500 when they break a window and they probably had about 30p in pennies that were left in the drawer,\" she said.\n\n\"We just have to write it off as a loss. We work hard for a week to pay the burglar - that's how it works out.\"\n\nMore than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the number of theft and burglary offences in England and Wales fell as many people stayed at home.\n\nMinister for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said, with levels expect to return to those seen before Covid-19, the tagging pilot was \"critical\".\n\n\"We want to make sure we help those offenders get back on the straight and narrow,\" he said.\n\n\"We think 24-hour-a-day supervision, through this tag on their ankle, will help them to realise that they're effectively being watched, and therefore choose something else to do, other than go back to their former crime.\n\n\"It's a rigorous supervision in a way that we haven't really seen before and we think it will have a big impact.\"\n\nMore than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released from prison, according to MoJ figures.\n\nIt said these types of crimes cost the public an estimated \u00a34.8bn a year, yet 79% of theft cases and 62% of robbery cases resulted in no suspect being identified - compared with an average of 24% in all other cases.\n\nFollowing the pilots, the MoJ said it planned to roll out the scheme, run by the National Probation Service, to a further 13 forces in September.\n\nTags have already been introduced in parts of England and Wales to monitor whether offenders who who were convicted of committing crimes while fuelled with alcohol, have been drinking.\n\nThe \"sobriety tags\" monitor sweat levels of the wearer every 30 minutes to see whether they have drunk alcohol. The probation service is then alerted if they have had a drink.\n\nGwent's Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said a small number of offenders were committing thefts, burglaries and robberies.\n\n\"Offenders tend to be serial offenders doing quite a lot of these types of crime over a short period of time, that can be very forensically aware, they can locate premises that aren't overlooked so there aren't any witnesses and then it becomes very difficult to pull those clues together to solve that particular crime.\n\n\"Obviously with the ability to be able to tag our persistent offenders it means we're able to see where they are and if they're in proximity of offences that have occurred,\" she said.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Leading care organisations in England are warning of a \"cliff edge\" when emergency funding to support infection control and visits during the pandemic runs out in two weeks.\n\nSome providers fear the financial pressure could force them to close.\n\nThey say the budget was a missed chance to tackle the short- and long-term funding crisis in adult social care.\n\nIn 2019, on his first day as prime minister, Boris Johnson committed to 'fix the crisis in social care'.\n\nMinisters say they will bring forward proposals this year.\n\nThe emergency funds are to help care homes and home care services with additional Covid costs, including infection control, visiting measures and extra staffing.\n\nThe Victory Care home in Chatham, Kent, which normally cares for 60 people, has used some of its emergency money on staff to organise visits and testing.\n\n\"Everything from extra newsletters, Zoom calls, the telephone calls, and then there will be additional resources put into ensuring people are tested, ensuring the tests are logged so that we know what our team's results are,\" says Raina Summerson, chief executive of Agincare, which runs the home.\n\nGerry Smith, whose mother Julia moved there last October, is tested every time she visits.\n\n\"We haven't got out of the pandemic yet, so we still need to keep the precautions going for a bit longer until everyone's had the vaccine that's going to have the vaccine and the numbers have dropped,\" says Ms Smith.\n\nBut if emergency funding stops in two weeks, there are fears about the impact on care home visiting, testing and even the survival of some providers.\n\nMs Summerson says whilst Agincare is secure, the care homes and home care services she runs have seen wage bills rise between 10% and 18% during the pandemic.\n\nBut, she says, fee rates offered by councils and the NHS for the year ahead are mainly staying the same or increasing by 1-2%.\n\n\"We will still have costs related to additional staffing for visiting, we will still need to be doing testing regularly, we will still need to be doing robust - more so than usual - infection control procedures,\" she says.\n\n\"Who will suffer through this lack of funding? People who desperately need services, and our workforce who have given so much over this last year. It feels like a real slap in the face for them.\"\n\nThe seven organisations which signed the statement call themselves an \"unprecedented alliance\" of local politicians, council social service directors, care providers and people who need support.\n\nThey say the absence of social care in the Budget was \"disappointing and a missed chance to provide much-needed certainty\".\n\nThey want the government to publish its long-promised social care reform plan by the summer.\n\nThree years ago, Christie Michael and her mother Maria moved from one area where they were both eligible for council support to another with a very different approach.\n\nChristie has a rare condition that means her joints dislocate very easily.\n\nBut once they moved, Christie was not entitled to local authority funded help, and rather than four hours support a day, her mum was offered an hour and 15 minutes.\n\nThey say the council told them they would have to pay \u00a375 a week towards the care.\n\n\"We decided to stop the care, we just could not afford it.\n\n\"We already needed food banks before when we were getting free care,\" says Christie.\n\nShe is now her mother's full-time carer.\n\n\"I feel like I owe her and I want to do it, but it means that I don't have a life and it means that my physical health and my mental health is declining as well.\"\n\n\"I absolutely do not think you should get social care according to your postcode.\n\n\"It should be nationwide, available to everyone.\"\n\nThe full list of signatories is:",

And services into Clermiston were suspended for a weekend following a serious attack in Drumbrae on 5 March.\n\nThe driver of the bus from the Drumbrae attack, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: \"I saw a youth coming to my side and he banged the side of the bus.\n\n\"Then I could see the rock coming towards my driver's window and it just shattered.\"\n\nThe driver was given an emergency appointment at the eye hospital and doctors said he had some abrasions to his cornea.\n\nHe added: \"That night I couldn't sleep.

            "content": "The prime minister's former aide, Dominic Cummings, has criticised the Department of Health as \"a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE\" at the start of the pandemic.\n\nHe said that was why Boris Johnson had taken direct control of the vaccine programme.\n\nHe also told MPs Mr Johnson approached him about working in Downing Street the week before he took office.\n\nHe said he asked him to \"help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare\".\n\nMr Cummings said he agreed but one of his preconditions was that science funding should be doubled.\n\nHe was giving evidence to MPs on the Science and Technology Committee about the creation of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency know as Aria.\n\nBut in his first public appearance since leaving office, he also criticised the health department's response to the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \"In spring 2020 you had a situation where the Department for Health was just a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE and all of that, you had serious problems with the funding bureaucracy for therapeutics on Covid.\"\n\nHe said the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had advised Number 10 that the vaccine rollout should not be run out of the Department for Health and that a separate task force should be created.\n\n\"It's not coincidental that the vaccine programme worked the way it did. It's not coincidental that to do that we had to take it out of the Department of Health,\" he added.\n\n\"We had to have it authorised very directly by the prime minister and say strip away all the normal nonsense that we can see is holding back funding.\"\n\nBut a source at the health department told the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming that getting the vaccine programme established was a \"massive team effort\".\n\nThey added: \"Everyone in DHSC was and is spending their time focused on saving lives, expanding the world leading vaccine rollout and getting through this pandemic.\"\n\nThe Vaccine Taskforce is a team of almost 200 people at the Department for Business that was established to make sure the UK got promising vaccines.\n\nMr Cummings said as the country emerges from lockdown there needs to be an \"urgent very, very hard look\" by Parliament at \"what went wrong and why\" during the pandemic.\n\n\"One of the most obvious lessons is the incredible value potentially of getting science and technology stuff right, the disaster that can come if you don't get it right.\"\n\nIt was this \"horrific Whitehall bureaucracy\" he wanted to strip away when he championed the new \"high risk\" Aria scientific research agency, he told MPs.\n\nHe said: \"The prime minister came to speak to me the Sunday before he became prime minister and said: 'Would I come in to Downing Street to try and help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare?'.\n\n\"I said, yes, if first of all you are deadly serious about actually getting Brexit done and avoiding a second referendum; secondly, double the science budget; third, create some Aria like entity, and fourth support me in trying to change how Whitehall works and the Cabinet Office works because it is a disaster zone. And he said 'deal'.\"\n\nAnswering MPs' questions about science funding, Mr Cummings said scientists had been lobbying for the creation of a body such as Aria that would have \"extreme freedom\" but he said he was aware that this was \"completely hostile to normal bureaucracy\".\n\nThe government says Aria will fund \"high-risk, high-reward\" scientific research and \"help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower\".\n\nIt will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS.\n\nAria, which has \u00a3800m funding over four years, will have a \"higher tolerance for failure than is normal\", ministers say.\n\nBut the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).\n\nFor 2020-21, the government has allocated \u00a310.36bn for its research programmes and bodies.\n\nLabour said there needed to be greater transparency around how the agency would operate.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler, who sits on the science committee, said because Aria was exempt from freedom of information requests this would undoubtedly \"raise alarm bells\" about how taxpayers' money would be spent given \"the recent PPE scandals\".\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the \"corporate governance arrangements are very robust\".\n\nHe added he would be responsible for reporting to Parliament on Aria and that the agency would have to submit accounts that would be scrutinised by MPs.\n\n\"I think there will be a great deal of transparency and oversight,\" he added.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, chair Greg Clark said Mr Cummings had agreed to give evidence on the Covid pandemic to a joint inquiry by the science and health committees.",

Their ages meant they were included in the fourth priority group for the rollout of the vaccine.\n\nThe latest government figures show that 24,839,906 first doses of a Covid vaccine have now been given in the UK, with some 1,663,646 people receiving a second dose.\n\nCountries across Europe are seeking further clarity on the jab's safety, amid criticism of their decision to suspend its use.\n\nDenmark was first to pause its use of the vaccine, followed by Norway and Iceland. Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Spain, Latvia and Sweden are the latest to follow suit.\n\nGermany, France and Italy have said they are awaiting the outcome of the EMA investigation.\n\nThey said they had opted to pause their use of the drug as a \"precautionary measure\".\n\nOther countries, including Austria, have halted the use of certain batches of the jab, while Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer it.\n\nDr Phil Bryan, vaccines safety lead at the MHRA, said that people \"should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so\".\n\n\"We are closely reviewing reports but given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.\"\n\nThe WHO, which is also investigating the reports, says there is no evidence that the clots were linked to the vaccine and it has urged countries not to pause their vaccination programmes.\n\nProf Jeremy Brown, a member of the UK government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said concerns about blood clots were \"overblown\" as they were unlikely to be linked to the jab.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme pausing its use would cause more illness and deaths than would be prevented \"by the unlikely situation that there's an increased risk of a very rare event occurring as a consequence of the vaccine\".\n\nSir Kent Woods, former chief executive of the MHRA and former chair of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast there would have been a \"denting of public confidence because of the disorderly situation in Europe\" and by suspending the use of the jab countries were \"increasing the risk to the population\".\n\nDr Jess Harvey, a GP in Shropshire, said she had received several calls from patients concerned about the possibility of blood clots linked to the vaccine.\n\nShe said she had not had any appointments cancelled yet but was worried about no-shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Public Health England said on Tuesday that it was investigating a new coronavirus variant previously reported by the Philippines, after two cases were identified in England.\n\nIt said one case was linked with international travel, while the other was still under investigation.\n\nPHE also said that two cases of the P.1 variant of concern first found in Brazil had been identified in England - with one in the West Midlands and another in Haringey, London.\n\nThis variant has a mutation - known as E484 - that means it can escape some of the immune response, which may mean vaccines work less effectively against it.\n\nBoth cases were linked with international travel to Brazil, PHE said, and bring the total number of UK cases of the variant to 12.",

She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family \"is absolutely fine\" and most people are being \"unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit\". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that \"it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination\". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to \"hold the line\" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown.",

            "content": "Tanzania's President John Magufuli has died aged 61, the country's vice-president has announced.\n\nHe died on Wednesday from heart complications at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, Samia Suluhu Hassan said in an address on state television.\n\nMr Magufuli had not been seen in public for more than two weeks, and rumours had been circulating about his health.\n\nOpposition politicians said last week that he had contracted Covid-19, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nMr Magufuli was one of Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptics, and called for prayers and herbal-infused steam therapy to counter the virus.\n\n\"It is with deep regret that I inform you that today... we lost our brave leader, the president of the Republic of Tanzania, John Pombe Magufuli,\" Vice-President Hassan said in the announcement.\n\nShe said there would be 14 days of national mourning and flags would fly at half mast.\n\nAccording to Tanzania's constitution, Ms Hassan will be sworn in as the new president within 24 hours and should serve the remainder of Mr Magufuli's five-year term which he began last year.\n\nMr Magufuli was last seen in public on 27 February, but Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa insisted last week that the president was \"healthy and working hard\".\n\nHe blamed the rumours of the president's ill-health on \"hateful\" Tanzanians living abroad.\n\nBut opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that his sources had told him Mr Magufuli was being treated in hospital for coronavirus in Kenya.\n\nWhen Covid-19 arrived in Tanzania, Mr Magufuli called on people to go to churches and mosques to pray. \"Coronavirus, which is a devil, cannot survive in the body of Christ... It will burn instantly,\" he said.\n\nHe declared Tanzania \"Covid-19 free\" last June, saying the virus had been eradicated by three days of national prayer.\n\nHe also mocked the efficacy of masks, expressed doubts about testing, and teased neighbouring countries which imposed health measures to curb the virus.\n\n\"Countries in Africa will be coming here to buy food in the years to come\u2026 they will be suffering because of shutting down their economy,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTanzania has not published details of its coronavirus cases since May, and the government has refused to purchase vaccines.\n\nOn Monday, police said they had arrested four people on suspicion of spreading rumours on social media that the president was ill.\n\n\"To spread rumours that he's sick smacks of hate,\" Mr Majaliwa said at the time.\n\nThe country is in a sombre mood - for the first time in its six decades of existence, Tanzania has lost a sitting president, John Pombe Magufuli.\n\nThe news of his death was received with shock and disbelief - although there were rumours of his illness, the authorities reassured the country that all was well with him.\n\nFrom his home district of Chato to the capital of Dodoma to the business hub of Dar es Salaam, most Tanzanians have been mourning Magufuli.\n\nThere are those with a different view, especially on social media led by exiled opposition politician Tundu Lissu, who has been speculating that President Magufuli had contracted Covid which led to his death, however the authorities have insisted the death was caused by heart complications.\n\nTanzanians are now turning their minds to the succession, which should see current Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan become the country's first female president.\n\nMr Magufuli was declared president on his 56th birthday in October 2015. He was elected for a second term following a disputed poll last year.\n\nHe was hailed for his anti-corruption stance during his time in office, but he was also accused of cracking down on dissent and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\nHis critics agree that Mr Magufuli contributed to Tanzania's development. He invested in large infrastructure projects such as a standard-gauge railway to connect the country with its neighbours, major highways, and a bus system in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam.\n\nHe also increased electricity production, reducing the need for power rationing.\n\nBut it is his approach to Covid-19 that many analysts say will define his legacy.\n\nIn Tanzania, people have reacted with grief and disbelief to the news of Mr Magufuli's death.\n\nOne, Joseph Petro, told the BBC he thought Mr Magufuli was a \"caring\" leader, adding \"he was helping people in one way or another\".\n\n\"I am really pained. I am personally pained,\" he said.\n\nAnother, Illuminata Abel, offered similar sentiments: \"He was not my relative, but he was someone who listened to people's problems, and he was down to earth.\"\n\nAfrican leaders have also come out to pay tribute.\n\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said: \"I have lost a friend, colleague and visionary ally,\" and declared a seven-day period of national mourning in Kenya.\n\nFormer Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called Mr Magufuli a \"partner in democracy\" and a \"patriot who loved his country\".\n\nBut Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that Mr Magufuli's \"politics, policies and Covid denialism\" had \"driven the country towards disaster\".",

            "content": "Scotland's train services are to be run by a public sector body, the Scottish government has announced.\n\nDutch firm Abellio will stop running the ScotRail franchise at the end of March next year.\n\nAfter this an \"arms-length\" Scottish government company will take over the running of services.\n\nAbellio has been running the franchise since 2015 but had its contract ended early amid criticism over cancellations and performance levels.\n\nAll ScotRail staff will transfer to the new Scottish government-owned entity.\n\nThe arrangement is being made under powers which allow the Scottish government to take over the rail franchise without a bidding process.\n\nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson said he was not able to say how long these \"operator of last resort\" arrangements would last for.\n\nHe said: \"I have decided that it would not be appropriate to award a franchise agreement to any party at this time, either through a competition or a direct award.\n\n\"That is why I have confirmed that, from the expiry of the current franchise, ScotRail services will be provided in public hands through a company wholly owned and controlled by the Scottish government.\n\n\"This approach will provide a stable platform for ScotRail services and certainty for passengers and staff.\"\n\nScotland's railways have already been temporarily nationalised since March last year to help the service cope with the impact of coronavirus.\n\nThe Scottish government has spent \u00a3452m in support for ScotRail, along with the Caledonian Sleeper, after passenger numbers dropped dramatically as a result of lockdown restrictions.\n\nMr Matheson described Abellio's time in charge of ScotRail as \"a difficult period\" which had confirmed the franchise system was \"broken and not working in the taxpayers' interest\".\n\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"There have been periods where they have under-performed, which has resulted in us having to take direct action.\n\n\"It's also a time when we have seen our rail network expand, with more new trains... and a greater range of services to the travelling public.\n\n\"So it's been very much a mixed report card that we would give to Abellio, but one that we did not believe lived up to our aspirations.\"\n\nMr Matheson said passengers would get better value for money under the new set-up \"because it will effectively cut out the company\" which has been running the system.\n\nThis includes the company's \"considerable\" management costs, he said.\n\nKevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser of train driver union Aslef, said: \"We welcome the beginning of the end of the failed franchise system here in Scotland.\n\n\"However, never again should people's railway ever be in the hands of the privateers.\n\n\"It's now for all us in the railway to build a railway that's accessible, affordable, and safe for the people of Scotland.\"\n\nThe TSSA union said: \"This announcement is long overdue - much like many ScotRail trains were whilst Abellio was in charge.\"\n\nThe RMT union said public ownership would deliver significant benefits for Scotland's rail workers, passengers and taxpayers.\n\nThe \"operator of last resort\" model that the Scottish government will use is currently being used by the UK government to run the East Coast franchise by means of the arms-length London North Eastern Railway company.\n\nIn Wales, day-to-day services are being run by a publicly-owned company after a significant fall in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic.\n\nScottish Tory transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: \"The SNP government must be entirely honest about how much this will cost taxpayers and clear about what demonstrable benefits it is expected to bring to passengers.\n\n\"It is important that this is being motivated by pragmatism not ideology.\n\n\"This is the same government that can't even build a couple of ferries which hardly instils confidence in them having the competence to run a rail service.\"\n\nScottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said the announcement was \"welcome progress\".\n\nHe said: \"Given Wales brought railways into public ownership last year, this has been a long time coming.\n\n\"Nationalisation of services is just the first step towards a greener, integrated public transport system which serves communities not shareholders.\"\n\nScottish Labour's transport spokesman Alex Rowley said: \"When SNP ministers awarded the contract to Abellio they told us we would have world leading services but for far too many that was not the experience.\n\n\"The Scottish government could have acted on this much earlier, and it is their repeated failures that have led us to this point.\"\n\nA statement from ScotRail posted to Twitter said: \"We want to reassure you that we'll keep operating a reliable service to support the vaccine rollout and the opening up of the economy over the coming months.\"We'll work closely with Transport Scotland to ensure a smooth transition to the new operator, to deliver stability for customers and railway staff.\"\n\nPrivatisation of the railways in the 1990s was both radical and controversial.\n\nEven some who had supported the privatisations of other state-owned assets such as BT and the electricity companies questioned whether breaking up British Rail and offering businesses franchises to run services would actually work out for the best.\n\nThey seemed to be proved right. The company that owned the lines, Railtrack, was brought back into public ownership as Network Rail. Some franchises proved unsuccessful or unviable so the state stepped in to keep the trains running.\n\nThe ScotRail franchise, despite plenty of controversies, was relatively free of trouble and has been operated by three separate companies over the years - Abellio now looks set to be the last.\n\nIn many ways though, Scotland's railways were more like a public private partnership than a business simply driven by the market. The Scottish government supported big improvements to the line between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the reopening of the Waverley Line in the borders.\n\nFor some, the renationalisation of Scotland's railway service will be seen as right or wrong as a mere point of principle. But the test for many passengers will be whether it results in better services or a greater degree of accountability.",

And it's about to get even smaller.\n\nA cut in the number of troops is expected in a defence review, due to be published next month.\n\nOptions include losing up to 10,000 soldiers from the regular Army's notional strength of 82,000 in order to help fund its modernisation.\n\nMinisters have made clear there will still have to be painful decisions for the armed forces, despite the extra \u00a316.5bn given to the Ministry of Defence over the next four years.\n\nA senior Army officer has told the BBC that technology will allow the Army to become \"leaner and more agile\".\n\nBut it comes amid warnings that the Army is already too small, and that more cuts will worry allies and limit its ability to fight.\n\nOver the past year the Army has been preparing for a radical transformation.\n\nIt wants to embrace new technologies - from drones and robots to artificial intelligence.\n\nBrig John Clark, the head of Army strategy, insists no decision on troop numbers has yet been made.\n\nBut he says by harnessing technology \"you're able to achieve the same effect with fewer people\".\n\nHowever, Jack Watling, of London's Royal United Services Institute warns of \"the excitement of new capabilities coming at the expense of traditional hard military power\".\n\nRemember, the majority of soldiers in a modern army are there to support and sustain a fighting force.\n\nThe tip of the spear, the combat element, is often about a third of an army's total strength.\n\nThe rumours in Whitehall suggest the Army will be losing several infantry battalions, part of the fighting force.\n\nMr Watling says an army of just 72,000 should still be able to take and hold \"a small town\", bearing in mind the British army struggled to secure the Iraqi city of Basra, when it was 100,000 strong.\n\nIt might appear to be a contradiction, but the Army believes even if it's smaller, it can still have a bigger presence around the world.\n\nIt's embraced the government's mantra of \"global Britain\".\n\nFor the Army it'll mean operating from a number of \"global hubs\" in parts of the world where it already has a presence - such as Kenya, Oman and Brunei.\n\nBrig Clark says: \"We see those as launchpads through which we can routinely send more of the British army out to train, develop and demonstrate.\"\n\nHe says by being forward-deployed the Army will be able to respond and manage threats \"more rapidly and decisively\".\n\nHe describes it as prevention rather than cure.\n\nIt signals a shift in the way the Army wants to operate.\n\nBrig Clark talks of \"smaller teams that can go out there and compete beneath the threshold of conflict\" - the so-called \"grey zone\" where militaries operate discreetly in the blurred lines between war and peace.\n\nBen Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: \"I see a clear aspiration to do more with the Army further away, but forces cannot be everywhere at once.\"\n\nThere are certainly questions as to whether a smaller army, spread around the world, will be able to meet its existing commitments to Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).\n\nIn theory, the UK can deploy a war fighting division to defend Europe.\n\nMr Watling of Rusi says among the components of a division would be around 200 main battle tanks.\n\nThe British army is likely to have half that number.\n\nMr Barry, of the IISS, says allies in eastern Europe are left wondering whether the British army of the future will be sending \"armour and infantry or aggressive algorithms\" to help defend them.\n\nThe Army's plans do include updating increasingly obsolete armoured vehicles and the addition of more potent long-range artillery systems.\n\nBrig Clark insists the Army will still be able to field a warfighting division.\n\nBut the Army's definition of a division appears to be changing.\n\nThe UK already has one of the smallest armies of any major European nation.\n\nAnd that worries its closest military ally, the United States.\n\nUS General Mark Milley's plea to the British army at a London conference just a few years ago was that \"you don't get any smaller\".\n\nKim Darroch, the former British ambassador to Washington, recently said the message from the Pentagon was \"\u2026do not go down any further and expect to retain your current credibility\".\n\nThe truth is that the British Army's credibility had already been damaged in the eyes of the US.\n\nAmerica had to come to the rescue of the British army in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMr Barry and Mr Watling also question whether an army of 72,000 could do another Helmand - a long, enduring campaign.\n\nBut the British army has a recent history of biting off more than it can chew.",

            "content": "A \"once-in-a-generation modernisation\" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said.\n\nThe prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles.\n\n\"I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,\" he said.\n\nLabour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded.\n\nOutlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video link as he is self-isolating - said the benefits \"will go far beyond our armed forces\".\n\nMr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth \u00a316.5bn in new money over four years.\n\nHowever economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of \u00a316.5bn was a \"misleading way to present this announcement\".\n\nHe continued: \"It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be \u00a37bn higher than it would have been under previous plans.\"\n\nMr Johnson said: \"Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe.\"\n\nThe PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as \"the foremost naval power in Europe\" with a \"renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK\".\n\nHe also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as:\n\n\"From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,\" Mr Johnson added.\n\nThis is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past.\n\nThe Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm.\n\nBoris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs.\n\nThe extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber.\n\nDespite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a \u00a313bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made.\n\nThe MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely.\n\nAnd good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments - there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a \"spending announcement without a strategy\" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both.\n\nMr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was \"very thin indeed\".\n\nFormer foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson \"not to listen to any voices in his ear\" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending.\n\nAnd Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to \"quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment\" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, \"now and going forwards\".\n\nThe PM responded by telling the Commons: \"I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue.\"\n\nGen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" by the announcement.\n\n\"But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said \"letting go\" of some older weapons would create \"headroom\" for new investment.\n\nHe added: \"When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities.\"\n\nThe funding announcement is part of the first conclusions of the government's Integrated Review which looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy.\n\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give \"a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline\".\n\nConservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: \"This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces.\"\n\nBut he said the \"key takeaway\" for him was the \"message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability\".",

He left the ITV programme later that day.\n\nThe total of 57,121 complaints is 12,600 more than those made over a race row on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.\n\nThe duchess herself is among those who have complained to the watchdog.\n\nMorgan responded on Twitter: \"Only 57,000? I've had more people than that come up & congratulate me in the street for what I said. The vast majority of Britons are right behind me.\"\n\nOfcom, which has regulated British TV since 2003, has already launched an investigation into Good Morning Britain. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman said the investigation was ongoing.\n\nA further 4,398 complaints have been made about the Oprah interview itself, which was broadcast on ITV on 8 March. Some objected to the duke and duchess' claims about the Royal Family, some about the timing given the Duke of Edinburgh's ill health, and some about the use of allegedly misleading press headlines in the programme.\n\nOfcom said: \"We're assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate.\" The regulator did not say which aspect of the interview had attracted the complaints.\n\nIn the in-depth interview, Meghan told Oprah her mental health became so bad she \"didn't want to be alive any more\", that she did not receive the help she asked for from Buckingham Palace, and that an unnamed member of the Royal Family had queried \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\n\nThe day after its UK broadcast, Morgan said he did not believe her, adding that \"the fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible\".\n\nHe briefly walked off the programme after clashing with weather presenter Alex Beresford, and he was criticised by mental health charity Mind.\n\nMorgan later conceded that it was \"not for me to question if she felt suicidal\", but has defended his \"right to be allowed to have an opinion\".",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Energy customers set for refunds when direct debits are too high\n\nCustomers who pay too much to their energy supplier through their monthly direct debit payment should receive automatic annual refunds, Ofgem says.\n\nFor years, customers have complained that energy firms can hoard thousands of pounds of overpayments and would only return it on request.\n\nNow the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of \u00a31.4bn.\n\nIt said some were using the money for \"unsustainable business practices\".\n\nEnergy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year.\n\nFor the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account.\n\nOften the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months.\n\nHowever, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid.\n\nThis can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customer was shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him \u00a33,049 - with similar complaints having been made for years.\n\nCurrent rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months.\n\nNow, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract.\n\nThat would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account.\n\nOfgem estimates that people would receive \u00a365 on average, under the latest calculations.\n\n\"These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,\" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem.\n\n\"This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship.\"\n\nThe regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable.\n\nTo prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation.\n\nAny customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year.\n\nThe Energy Ombudsman received 1,000 complaints about credit balances last year.\n\n\"Just as people are expected to pay their energy bills on time, we think it's fair to expect energy suppliers to do the same with refunds,\" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman.\n\n\"We know from looking at complaints that suppliers can sometimes take too long to issue refunds, which can be stressful for consumers.\"\n\nOn behalf of suppliers, Energy UK said: \"Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year.\n\n\"Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem's proposals.\"",

A large granite stone marks the spot, placed there in the early 20th century.\n\nThe council's Spring and St Patrick's Day programme promises to \"bring some colour\" to the city and district, according to mayor Brian Tierney.\n\nHe thanked event organisers for a programme that \"strikes a balance between giving the public something to look forward to and celebrate, while also keeping everyone safe\".\n\nEvent organiser Jacqueline Whoriskey said: \"While we will not be holding any public events or gatherings, we have focused in on how we can creatively bring the spring spirit to our streets with artwork and installations, with fairy dwellings and artistic sculptures that can be enjoyed by everyone when out getting some fresh air and exercise\".\n\nArmagh's At Home With St Patrick Festival includes events such as online wreath making and an Irish dancing master class.\n\nAll events are free of charge, however, some do require registration in advance.\n\nThe council is marking Irish Language Week and St Patrick's Day with a series of online performances and storytelling.\n\nAll events have moved online and the festival includes music and dance performances, streamed live from the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh and the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.\n\nThe council is streaming a series of craft workshops, musical entertainment and dance performances live on social media channels throughout the day.\n\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland for St Patrick's Day\n\nPolice in Northern Ireland have appealed for anyone celebrating St Patrick's Day to ensure that they adhere to all public health regulations.\n\nHundreds of extra PSNI officers are set to be deployed across Northern Ireland on Wednesday, through to the early hours of Thursday.\n\nThe substantial policing operation will see officers patrolling beauty spots and the Holyland area of south Belfast.\n\nPolice said that a number of gatherings have already been broken up by officers in south Belfast ahead of St Patrick's Day.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that people know the rules and those breaking them could face fines.\n\nSaint Patrick lived in the 5th Century AD and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity.\n\nWhile St Patrick really existed, and some of his writings survive, his value does not really come from historical details but from the inspiration of a man who returned to the country where he had been a child slave, in order to bring the message of Christ.\n\nHe is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe city's St Patrick's Festival runs from 12 to 17 March, with more than 100 online events around the theme of Awaken Ireland.\n\nOrganisers have partnered with Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 for the virtual parade.\n\nThe celebrations will be broadcast around the world to a potential audience of 80 million people, organisers said.\n\nThe Queen has extended her best wishes to the people of Ireland for St Patrick's Day, 10 years after she visited.\n\nIn her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: \"We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.\"\n\nL\u00e1 Fh\u00e9ile P\u00e1draig sona daoibh go l\u00e9ir\n\n\n\nAhead of #StPatricksDay tomorrow, The Queen has sent her best wishes to the people of Ireland \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/FQv88xVz5q\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Her Majesty is pictured with @PresidentIRL and during her historic visit to Ireland in 2011. pic.twitter.com/4OKpaAp74v \u2014 The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) March 16, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

And I internalised it and I told myself it was my fault because I still went in the room with him.\"\n\nShe says she coped through self-harm, and going through the eating disorder bulimia.\n\nIn the series, she also talks about a \"promise ring\" which was worn by some young stars including herself and the Jonas Brothers, as a commitment to only have sex after marriage.\n\n\"So what, I'm supposed to come out to the public after saying I have a promise ring? Six months later, I'm supposed to say, well I had sex, even though it was rape? Some people aren't going to see it that way.\"\n\nThe series also shows the damage Demi's drug overdose had in 2018.

            "content": "Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK \"match-fit\" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy.\n\nThe prime minister said there would be \"more investment\" in infrastructure and skills around the country.\n\nHe also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride.\n\nThe government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday.\n\nBut a group of MPs has warned that \"general ineptitude\" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army.\n\nThe Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat.\n\nSome details are being pre-released, including the plan to move 500 jobs to the Foreign Office's East Kilbride hub - which follows news that the Cabinet Office will transfer at least 500 civil servants to nearby Glasgow by 2024.\n\nThe government has promised \"further commitments\" to \"strengthening the UK's core industrial base\" in the Integrated Review, including building ships in Scotland and armoured vehicles in Wales.\n\nThere will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added.\n\nThe Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War.\n\nBut the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology.\n\nAnd, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom.\n\nMinisters argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad.\n\nThe test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people.\n\n\"So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people.\"\n\nHe added that the UK's \"international ambitions must start at home\", with investment in regional industry \"ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world\".\n\nThe government has said \"further jobs\" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England.\n\nIt has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by \u00a36.6bn in real terms, but, since then, it has increased by \u00a33bn in real terms.\n\nA report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries.\n\nIt described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as \"woeful\" and criticised what it called \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" over the past two decades.\n\nIn a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are\".\n\nHe added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\".",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "A man with learning difficulties who admitted to a murder 30 years ago should have his conviction quashed because he confessed to police without a lawyer present, his solicitor says.\n\nCampbell, who was 19 at the time, says he was \"put under pressure\" to \"admit to something that I didn't do\".\n\nPolice say the interviews were fair, while a judge ruled them admissible.\n\nMr Mullinger believes officers failed to tell him that his client - who was accused of shooting dead a London shopkeeper - had waived his right to a solicitor because they realised that he would try to change Campbell's mind.\n\nHe told Newsnight: \"The police did not have anything like sufficient evidence, probably even to get a prosecution off the ground, let alone a conviction without something more. And the more was going to be a confession.\"\n\nCampbell, 50, who suffered a brain injury when he was eight months old, has always protested his innocence and has been fighting his conviction for many years. He was released from prison on life licence in 2002.\n\nOn 22 July 1990, two men entered a shop in east London intent on robbery. The owner, 42-year-old Baldev Hoondle, pressed a panic alarm before one of the men pulled out a gun and shot him in the head at close range.\n\nNewsnight approached Mr Hoondle's family but they did not wish to participate in the programme.\n\nShopkeeper Baldev Hoondle was murdered in his off-licence in July 1990\n\nCampbell - a local teenager - was arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and brought in for questioning at Hackney police station.\n\nOn 1 December 1990, Mr Mullinger attended a police interview with his client alongside an appropriate adult from social services who was there because the police accepted that Campbell was mentally vulnerable.\n\nMr Mullinger and the appropriate adult left at around 6.30pm thinking interviews were over for the day, with Mr Mullinger saying that police officers had agreed to call him back if that changed.\n\nThe police say Campbell then decided to confess to murder and had waived his right to a solicitor.\n\nOfficers then brought his foster mother in to the police station and she agreed to become the appropriate adult for the new interview, which went ahead without Mr Mullinger's knowledge.\n\nHe told Newsnight he was misled and believes the police realised that getting a confession would be less likely if Campbell was legally represented.\n\nHe said: \"The officer should have telephoned me and said, 'I think Oliver wants to speak to me. Will you come over to be part of the interview?' And I would have said, 'yes, of course'\u2026 And we would have had the interview.\n\n\"I don't know how that interview would have panned out, but it would have been undoubtedly a fair interview.\"\n\nArthur Mullinger believes Campbell's conviction should be quashed because the confession would be ruled inadmissible today\n\nCampbell's foster mother, who was a magistrate, was so shocked by his confession to murder that she was physically sick. She said at the time that she felt manipulated by the police.\n\nNewsnight obtained the original tapes of the police interviews conducted and traced the senior officer who interviewed Campbell in 1990.\n\nThe officer, who the BBC is choosing not to name, denies that the interview was unfair and told Newsnight he suspects Campbell is \"in denial of murder\", adding: \"When he was interviewed by me, he had the assistance of a solicitor or an appropriate adult to look after him...\n\n\"It is correct he did not have a solicitor present when he confessed. However, his appropriate adult was present throughout and he had waived his right to have his solicitor.\"\n\nHe added: \"His interview tape recordings were played at his trial and the jury had ample opportunity to consider whether or not his confession was genuine\", and said this was \"not the only evidence which incriminated him\".\n\nThe officer said the interviews were tape recorded and conducted in accordance with the Codes of Practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which applied at that time.\n\nBut Mr Mullinger and Campbell's current legal team say his conviction should be quashed because the confession would be ruled inadmissible today.\n\nGlyn Maddocks and Michael Birnbaum have been fighting to clear Campbell's name for the past 20 years.\n\nOliver Campbell was 19 years old when he was convicted of murder in 1991\n\nMr Maddocks said: \"Oliver Campbell is a mentally disabled person who was no match for a group of experienced and manipulative police officers.\n\n\"The 'admissions' Oliver made were inconsistent, varied noticeably from the evidence and in some places were quite absurd.\"\n\nMr Birnbaum QC said: \"I can't prove this - this is a strong suspicion [but] I think they realised that they were never going to get an admission from him if a solicitor was present.\"\n\nCampbell's confession statements were ruled admissible at his trial in 1991. Mr Birnbaum QC told Newsnight: \"The trial judge conducted a hearing about whether to admit that statement - declare it admissible - and said that there had been no impropriety by the police.\n\n\"But I don't believe the defence counsel brought up any of these to my mind pretty obvious points that could be made about the unfairness of the police conduct.\"\n\nThe prosecution relied on three main strands of evidence apart from Campbell's confession:\n\nBut Campbell's lawyers say his confession was key, and there was no solicitor present for that.\n\nCampbell was released from prison after serving 11 years in 2002 and is now living in sheltered accommodation in Suffolk. He is still a convicted murderer, a label he says is ruining his life.\n\nHe told Newsnight that the police questioning was unfair, adding: \"I was put under pressure\u2026 to say things that I didn't want to say at the end of the day\u2026 to admit to something that I didn't do. And I felt scared at the time.\"\n\nSome of the police interview tactics were later described by an independent psychologist as \"highly manipulative and relentless\", while one of the questions lasted almost three minutes.\n\nThe case is now being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for the second time. In 2005, it decided not to refer it back to the Court of Appeal. A key reason for this was that it argued that many of the apparent weaknesses in evidence had already been considered by the courts.\n\nMr Birnbaum QC says there are fresh grounds today, both on the detail of the evidence and the circumstances surrounding Campbell's confession.\n\nHe said: \"The law and practise in regard to the way that mentally challenged suspects and defendants are treated has changed very considerably in their favour.\n\n\"Today his interviews would never be heard by a jury because of the unfairness of the police questioning and because I don't think the prosecution could prove that he understood the implications of being interviewed without a solicitor.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"The case was fully investigated at the time with a range of evidence brought before a jury who convicted the defendant in 1991.\n\n\"We are aware this matter is with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.\"\n\nWatch the full report on Newsnight at 22:45 GMT on Tuesday 16 March on BBC 2 or later on iPlayer.",

            "section": "Family & Education",
            "content": "The government's programme to help pupils who have missed school time catch up may not be reaching the most disadvantaged children, a report says.\n\nThe National Tutoring Programme was launched last year to give extra tuition to the UK's poorest pupils.\n\nBut fewer than half of pupils who have already received tuition as part of the scheme are from the poorest families, a National Audit Office report found.\n\nThe Department for Education says it has invested \u00a32bn to help pupils.\n\nChair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, said the Department for Education's \"failure to do its homework\" had hit children who were already most disadvantaged.\n\nThe Labour MP said: \"DfE must now ensure its support is properly targeted to prevent the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers from widening even further.\"\n\nIn June last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a \u00a31bn catch-up fund to help pupils in England.\n\nThe package included \u00a3350m for the National Tutoring Programme to help the most disadvantaged pupils, as well as \u00a3650m for schools to help children from all backgrounds catch up.\n\nAlthough the tuition scheme is aimed at disadvantaged children, the Dfe has not specified what proportion of children accessing it should be disadvantaged.\n\nThe report found that of the 125,200 children who had been allocated a tutoring place by February, 41,100 had started to receive tuition. Of those, 44% were eligible for pupil premium funding - a grant given to schools in England to help disadvantaged children.\n\nThat raised \"questions over the extent to which the scheme will reach the most disadvantaged children\", the report said.\n\nAcademic mentors are also being placed in schools serving poorer communities to help provide intensive catch-up support. But demand had \"outstripped supply\", the report added.\n\nMentors had been placed in 1,100 schools by February, but it had received requests from 1,789 eligible schools - meaning more than 600 had not received one.\n\nThe report says the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic had been an \"unprecedented challenge\" for the DfE.\n\nBut it says aspects of its response could have been better and done more quickly. The DfE had no pre-existing plan for managing mass disruption to schooling, it added.\n\nIn April last year, the DfE considered providing 602,000 laptops or tablets and 100,000 4G routers to ensure vulnerable children and those in priority year groups had access to digital devices.\n\nBut due to the practical difficulty of supplying so many devices, it decided to instead focus on children with a social worker and care leavers, alongside disadvantaged pupils in Year 10 - a total of 220,000 laptops and tablets, and 50,000 routers.\n\nThe report said \"substantial amounts of equipment did not reach local authorities and academy trusts until June\", meaning many children may not have been able to access remote learning until well into the second half of the summer term.\n\nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, said it was \"crucial that the department monitors the impact of its catch-up arrangements, particularly on disadvantaged children, and acts on the results\".\n\nAnd Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government had \"been the cause of a great deal of unnecessary confusion and upset\" and had \"prioritised good press over good practice\".\n\nCllr Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said it was \"vital that catch-up support is strictly targeted to avoid any further widening of education gaps between disadvantaged pupils and their peers\".\n\nA DfE spokesperson said it had \"acted swiftly at every turn to help minimise the impact on pupils' education and provide extensive support for schools, colleges and early years settings\".\n\n\"We have invested over \u00a32bn into schemes to provide pupils with devices for remote education and ambitious catch-up plans - with funding targeted at disadvantaged children and young people who need support the most.\"",

            "section": "Scotland politics",
            "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has said she \"strongly refutes\" allegations by a Conservative MP about her government's handling of complaints against Alex Salmond.\n\nFormer Brexit secretary David Davis used parliamentary privilege to claim there was a concerted effort in the SNP to encourage women to make complaints.\n\nThe first minister rejected this as \"the latest instalment in Alex Salmond's conspiracy theory\".\n\nShe said she would leave the Holyrood inquiry to consider the evidence.\n\nMs Sturgeon was repeatedly asked about the row at her Covid-19 briefing, but said she did not want the briefing to be \"sidetracked\" from health matters.\n\nThe intervention from Mr Davis at Westminster on Tuesday was the latest development in a long-running dispute between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond, her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader.\n\nMr Salmond took the Scottish government to court in 2018 over its investigation into two internal harassment complaints against him, with the government ultimately conceding ahead of a judicial review that the way it conducted the probe was \"unlawful\".\n\nHe was later charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, but was cleared of all of the allegations against him after a High Court trial in March 2020.\n\nIn his evidence to the Holyrood inquiry that was set up to examine what went wrong with the government investigation, Mr Salmond said there had been a \"malicious scheme\" among senior SNP figures to damage his reputation in the wake of the judicial review case.\n\nMr Davis, who is a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond, told the House of Commons on Tuesday evening that he had been passed evidence by a whistleblower, in the form of messages from a senior SNP official.\n\nHe read some messages out in the Commons and said they \"show that there is a concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" after the criminal investigation into Mr Salmond had started.\n\nNicola Sturgeon said she did not want to discuss the claims at a Covid-19 briefing\n\nAsked about this on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon said she was \"not able to add anything\" to the evidence she gave in a lengthy session in front of the inquiry earlier this month.\n\nShe said: \"Other than to say I refute - strongly refute - the suggestions and insinuations from David Davis in the House of Commons last night, I am not going to have this Covid briefing sidetracked by the latest instalment of Alex Salmond's conspiracy theory.\n\n\"I have given eight hours of evidence to the parliamentary committee looking in to this.\n\n\"They are able to assess the evidence - they have a job of work to do and I am going to allow them to do that while I get on with my job, of leading this Covid briefing.\"\n\nMr Davis also told MPs that he had it \"on good authority\" that there were messages between civil servants \"suggesting that the first minister's chief of staff is interfering in the complaints process against Alex Salmond\".\n\nHe said this showed the chief of staff - Liz Lloyd - had been aware of complaints as early as February 2018, whereas Ms Sturgeon has insisted she only learned of them that April.\n\nWhen asked whether she still had full confidence in her chief of staff, Ms Sturgeon replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a statement on behalf of one of the nine complainers from Mr Salmond's criminal trial was published by Rape Crisis Scotland.\n\nThe woman said that she had been approached by Scottish government HR about an investigation into Mr Salmond's behaviour in January 2018, and had spoken to Ms Lloyd \"to gain advice and an understanding of my obligations\".\n\nShe said Ms Lloyd had offered to convey her thoughts to senior civil servants, and that \"this was not 'interfering', but acting in line with my wishes\".\n\nDavid Davis told the Commons an unnamed whistleblower supplied the information he released using the special freedom of speech privileges MPs have.\n\nThat a former Conservative minister should do this in apparent sympathy with a former SNP leader and first minister is not as surprising as it might first appear.\n\nDespite their political disagreements, Alex Salmond and David Davis are old friends with Mr Davis appearing as a star guest in Mr Salmond's show at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017.\n\nMany of the messages between senior SNP officials discussing the criminal case against Alex Salmond have already been released to the Holyrood committee of inquiry for consideration.\n\nThe BBC understands the document alleging interference by the first minister's chief of staff in the earlier Scottish government investigation of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond has now been passed to the committee by the Crown Office, which handles prosecutions in Scotland.\n\nMSPs on that committee are currently preparing their report into this saga which is expected to be published next week, just before Holyrood breaks for the election.\n\nIn her evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said claims of a plot against Mr Salmond were \"absurd\".\n\nShe said her government had made a \"very serious error\" in its internal investigation process, but said it had nothing to hide and no reason to want to \"get\" Mr Salmond.\n\nFollowing Mr Davis's speech, a spokesman for the first minister said that \"as with Mr Salmond's previous claims and cherry picking of messages, the reality is very different to the picture being presented\".\n\nHe added: \"Every message involving SNP staff has been seen by the committee previously. Their views have been widely reported as dismissive of them.\"\n\nThe first of a number of expected reports about the row was published on Tuesday, in the form of an independent review of the government's recently-devised complaints handling process.\n\nLaura Dunlop QC recommended that investigations of harassment complaints against former ministers like Mr Salmond should be independent of government, saying that \"the risks of perception of bias, either in favour of or against the person complained about, are obvious\".\n\nThe report of the Holyrood inquiry committee and another into whether or not Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code in her dealings with Mr Salmond are expected to be published in the coming week.",

            "content": "NHS workers in Wales will get the bonus payment for the first time\n\nA bonus payment will be paid to all NHS and social care workers in Wales.\n\nThe Welsh government said it would pay nearly 222,000 people the equivalent of \u00a3735 each, with an element to cover tax and National Insurance deductions.\n\nIt means most would get \u00a3500, Health Minster Vaughan Gething said, adding it \"expresses our gratitude\" to those working in those jobs.\n\nBut the Royal College of Nursing warned \"a one-off Covid-19 bonus is not a significant and substantive pay rise\".\n\nIt is the second bonus for social care staff, and the first for NHS workers.\n\n\"Nurses have gone above and beyond in the past 12 months,\" said Helen Whyley, director of RCN Wales.\n\nShe called for fair pay that encouraged nurses to stay in the profession and attract more staff.\n\nHowever, the announcement was welcomed by the trade union Unison Cymru Wales, which said it was \"in contrast to the insulting approach of the Conservative UK government\".\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has recommended a 1% pay rise to an independent panel examining salaries of NHS staff in England.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said it was as much as ministers could give. The \u00a3735 payment is separate to NHS pay.\n\nThe Welsh Tories' Janet Finch-Saunders called for \"longer-term pay recognition\" for staff, while Plaid Cymru said the difference in health care and social care pay needed to be addressed.\n\nBoth parties backed a minimum wage for social care workers of \u00a310 an hour in the Senedd on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe bonus award, the Welsh government said, will benefit an estimated 221,945 people.\n\nThey include 103,600 social care staff, 90,000 NHS Wales staff, 2,345 deployed students and 26,000 primary care staff, including pharmacy, GP, dental and optometry workers.\n\nLast year a \u00a3500 payment was made to social care staff, but it did not cover any element of tax that would need to be paid on it.\n\nWelsh ministers argued the Treasury should cover it. Plaid had called the handling of the matter \"baffling\".\n\nThe Welsh government said it was working with councils - which fund social care - and trade unions to finalise how the new payments would work.\n\nAt a Covid briefing on Wednesday Mr Gething said the Welsh government would not set an \"arbitrary cap\" on a pay rise for NHS staff.\n\nThe issue of NHS pay rises is considered by independent pay review bodies who recommend how much staff should earn.\n\n\"For NHS staff it really does feel like a kick in the teeth for the UK government to say there would only be a 1% pay raise and that's what they want the pay review bodies to agree to,\" said Mr Gething.\n\n\"That isn't what we've done here in Wales, I've released the evidence and the letters that I have sent to those pay review bodies, we are not setting an arbitrary cap.\"\n\nThe announcement came ahead of a Senedd debate, where Plaid Cymru said it would call for social workers to receive \u00a310 an hour.\n\nDelyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru Senedd member, said: \"This is a one-off recognition, it's a bonus because of the sacrifices that everyone in these sectors have had to make this past year\n\n\"The wider conversation we should be having is about the fact that there is this huge disparity between what health workers, and what care workers receive.\"\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders, for the Welsh Conservatives, told BBC Wales she wanted to see \"longer-term pay recognition\" for staff, but said the payment was \"welcome news\".\n\nAsked what she would want to see in terms of a pay rise, she said: \"I don't think you can quantify or put in an actual percentage figure, but I just hope that here in Wales with the money that they now have that they actually do reward our health and social care workers.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

The town had an average case rate of 401.2 per 100,000 over that period.\n\nOver the past seven days, the rate for Wales was 42.5.\n\nAnglesey council leader Llinos Medi Huws said \"all options\" were being considered in discussions with schools.\n\nShe told Dros Frecwast, on Radio Cymru, that as well as the idea of closing schools discussions included whether there was a need for a local lockdown around Holyhead.\n\n\"We're looking at all options but we need to look at how realistic it is to enforce them because we're dependent on the local people complying with the new restrictions,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking to Newyddion S4C on Wednesday evening, Ms Huws said the council had decided to widen testing to include people with a wider range of symptoms.\n\nThe authority would also extend the opening hours of the testing centre in Holyhead and allow people to turn up without an appointment, she said.\n\nSo far this month, 54% of the 174 positive coronavirus cases on Anglesey - identified through the Test, Trace and Protect team - have been in and around Holyhead.\n\nStaff at Ysbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor, were caring for 32 patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday morning - 15 of whom had become infected in hospital, according to Alyson Constantine, acute care director at the hospital.\n\nShe added there were also 31 recovering patients who had had Covid.\n\nThe council said although some cases had links to the recent outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd, household, cross-household and workplace transmission in the Holyhead area were \"also increasing and a significant cause for concern\".\n\nPrevention and Surveillance Group chairman and deputy council chief executive Dylan Williams said: \"The situation in Holyhead and recent increase in cases is extremely concerning.\n\n\"We must all play our part now by following the all-important guidance - sticking to social distancing, wearing a mask when we need to and not mixing with family and friends.\n\n\"We understand that these measures are tough on everyone it is the only way we can return to some sort of normality.\"\n\nSpeaking at Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh government was \"concerned\" about growing rates of the virus in Merthyr Tydfil, Conwy and Anglesey.\n\nHe said in the case of Anglesey in particular, it was important to gain an understanding of why case numbers were rising.\n\n\"We are concerned about those three authorities in particular, because we're aware they have the most visible rise in case rates\", he said.\n\n\"If they'd followed the national trend overall then we would have seen a further reduction, so they do make a difference to the overall figure.\n\n\"In the one sense, it makes it much more visible, because the rest of Wales has been able to behave collectively together in such a way where we've been able to keep coronavirus rates low.\"\n\nDr Frank Atherton, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, said: \"Where you have small populations like Anglesey, like Merthyr for example, any movement in the numbers because of clusters of cases, due to household mixing or whatever, small changes in the numbers can lead to big changes in the rates because the population is quite small. So we're seeing a bit of that in Anglesey, I think.\"\n\nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: \"Although the rates have been falling, and falling very well, they do seem to be bottoming out - the message still has to be, whilst we get the vaccine rolled out we have to be cautious as a nation, particularly avoid mixing with households.\"\n\nWhen asked if we would see more local lockdowns, he said: \"The experience last year with local lockdowns wasn't very encouraging, we found that a once-for-Wales approach is more effective in bringing rates down.\n\n\"Local outbreaks can be managed locally - if we see spikes or occurrences in a local authority area or based on an employer then that will be managed locally. If the rates overall across Wales start to go up, then who knows - we can't rule out the fact we might have to reverse that.\"\n\nWhen asked about the flare-up on Anglesey, Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Janet Finch-Saunders said: \"I do not agree with local lockdowns.\"\n\nThe Aberconwy MS added: \"I think it's about finding out exactly how this happened, but it is fair to say that people are becoming very tired now of restricted movement.\"\n\nThe Welsh government said it was \"closely monitoring the situation\" and would \"consider whether further measures are needed\".",

There are restrictions which are unnecessary.\n\n\"We keep getting told it's based on data rather than dates, but when they don't have the data they still pick on our industry.\n\n\"The hospitality industry is happy to stick to the data - but unfortunately the Scottish government is not.\"\n\nUp to 50 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals under the new plans.\n\nWedding venues will continue to face some restrictions\n\nHowever, Duncan McConchie of the Wedding Industry Alliance said a continued ban on alcohol sales would \"turn venue owners into police\".\n\nHe said: \"People will drink, but they will go to their cars and drink. They will go to the toilets and drink.\n\n\"Whereas, if we are allowed to sell alcohol, we are then in charge of the alcohol that those guests consume.\"\n\nMr McConchie said the industry was \"broadly accepting and happy\" with Tuesday's announcements, \"but the devil is in the detail that comes back to bite us\".\n\nJulia Eeeles, who owns The One Lounge hairdressing and beauty salon in Glasgow, said partial reopening without allowing for beauty treatments would leave her worse off.\n\n\"The problem for me - and I think there will be a lot of beauty salons like this - is that I've got two hairdressers but 10 other members of staff.\n\n\"So I am actually under financial strain having to open up just for two people.\n\n\"It means I have to run the salon, run reception and use all my gas and electricity. It doesn't help me as a business owner.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon also announced that the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted from 5 April.\n\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\n\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\n\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\n\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\n\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date.\n\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\n\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".",

            "content": "Susannah Fish is a former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police\n\nA former police chief has said she would think \"very carefully\" about reporting a crime committed against her because of how she would be \"judged\".\n\nSusannah Fish, former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, said there was a \"toxic culture of sexism\" in significant parts of policing.\n\nBut the police chiefs' body said women who came forward would be listened to.\n\nIt comes after the killing of Sarah Everard sparked concerns for women's safety in public.\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Ms Fish was asked how she felt about reporting a crime to the police as a woman.\n\nShe replied that while reporting a crime against property was \"not an issue\", for a crime against herself she would \"probably struggle for how I would be judged\".\n\nMs Fish added that while some officers would be \"sensitive\", others would not.\n\n\"I also know in terms of conviction rates and the challenges of going through the criminal justice system, as a woman, it's thankless,\" she said.\n\n\"Endless repeated humiliation, telling your story over and over again, worrying whether you're ever going to be believed, putting yourself through that repeatedly, as well as the shame of what's happened to you.\"\n\nShe added that victim-blaming had become \"endemic\" and \"trying to then explain yourself and justify yourself, just feels to me to be incredibly difficult\".\n\nHowever, Olivia Pinkney, chief constable of Hampshire Police and representing the National Police Chiefs' Council, told the programme: \"When women have the courage to come forward to anyone, including the police, then they will be listened to, they will be heard, they will be supported.\n\n\"I know that happens, because I know that we follow up every case.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm sure that we get stuff wrong. But if we get it wrong, then we'll hear about it and we'll fix it.\"\n\nOn Monday, Ms Fish described the Met Police response to a vigil for Ms Everard last weekend as \"institutional\" misogyny.\n\nThe force faced criticism over its handling of the vigil, where officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Clapham Common in south London.\n\nThe home secretary has commissioned an independent investigation into the force's decisions, which were taken in the light of Covid restrictions.\n\nMet Commissioner Cressida Dick said she agreed on the need for a \"sober review\" but defended how officers responded to the \"really big crowd\".\n\nMs Everard, 33, went missing while walking home alone in Clapham on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in Kent woodland and a Met Police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder.\n\nAsked what she meant by institutional misogyny in the way the police handled the vigil, Ms Fish told Woman's Hour that while there were \"many good people\" in policing, it was about the \"mindset\" and \"culture\" of the institution and how decisions were made.\n\n\"I think there is still significant parts of policing where there is a very toxic culture of sexism, of misogyny that objectifies women,\" she added.\n\nUnder Ms Fish's leadership, Nottinghamshire Police was the first force to record misogyny as a hate crime in 2016.",

            "content": "People aged 50 and over in England are now being invited to book their appointment for a Covid vaccine.\n\nThis is the final group on the priority list, which covers 99% of those at high risk of dying from Covid-19.\n\nEveryone in the top nine priority groups should be offered a second dose by mid-July, up to 12 weeks after the first.\n\nNearly half of the UK adult population has had one vaccine dose - more than 25 million people.\n\nAround 1.7 million people have also had a second dose.\n\nIn Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, the over-50s are already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April.\n\nIn total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is:\n\nThe number of vaccines given this week in the UK is expected to top four million - nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India.\n\nThis could mean all those aged 50 and over will be offered one dose by the end of March, putting the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nAfter that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age.\n\nAll adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July.\n\nIt is 100 days since Margaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against Covid outside of clinical trials.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I'm determined no-one should miss out on the chance to protect themselves and urge everyone who is eligible to come forward.\"\n\nDr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS England's primary care director, said vaccine supplies would go up and down over the next few months linked to manufacturers' ability to supply their jabs.\n\n\"But this week and next we have larger supplies, so we want anyone in the top priority groups - people aged 50 and older as well as those working in health and care and anyone with an underlying health condition - to come forward soon to protect themselves and their loved ones,\" she said.\n\nTwo million text messages are being sent out to those aged 50-54 in England with a link allowing people to book an appointment through the national booking service website.\n\nPeople who cannot go online can call the service on 119.\n\nThe expansion of the Covid vaccine rollout comes after government reassurance that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - one of two being given to people in the UK - was safe, after 13 countries paused their use of it.\n\nExpect a surge in vaccinations in the next week or so. Extra supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have arrived from abroad to supplement existing stocks.\n\nThe target to offer a vaccine to all those aged 50 and over by mid-April will almost certainly be met ahead of schedule. It will then be the turn of younger adults.\n\nThe progress means the UK is easing restrictions as parts of Europe face new waves of infection.\n\nConcerns have been raised about safety of the AstraZeneca jab - the European regulator is investigating cases of blood clots, focusing on a rare type that affects the brain.\n\nEvidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal.\n\nThis is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause.\n\nIn Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm.\n\nIt's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime.\n\nAfter all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue.\n\nThe EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of rare blood clots in a tiny number of vaccinated people on Thursday.\n\nBut the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, and Downing Street has said there is no evidence to suggest the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to the clots.\n\nMr Hancock urged people to \"listen to the regulators\" and to \"get the jab\" as soon as they got the opportunity.\n\nA vaccine safety panel of the World Health Organization said it was \"carefully assessing the latest available data\" for the vaccine but, in the meantime, recommended that vaccinations should continue.\n\nA further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard. A further 5,758 people tested positive.\n\u2022 None Vaccines now available in NI to over 50s\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

He just tried to get into a ball and protect himself as best he could.\"\n\nMartin is aware of some of the details of the attack because his brother managed to ring him in the minutes afterwards.\n\nHowever, Martin was not fully aware of the critical nature of Glenn's injuries.\n\n\"He was quite lucid and by no means did I think that Glenn had been assaulted as badly as he had been.\n\n\"The next was Glenn couldn't be contacted and that's when Glenn's body was found.\n\n\"I still blame myself that I didn't act, didn't phone an ambulance.\n\n\"I wish I'd spoke longer to him, I wish I'd have said so many other things and if I had knew this was the last conversation I was going to have with Glenn. Tell him how much I loved him... talk about old times, and I didn't have that opportunity.\"\n\nThe Ulster Defence Association, formed in 1971, had tens of thousands of members at its peak.\n\nIt killed hundreds of people during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and often claimed responsibility for sectarian murders using the cover name the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF).\n\nThe UDA had remained a legal organisation until it was banned in August 1992.\n\nNotorious attacks by the UFF included the shooting dead of five Catholics at a Belfast bookmakers in 1992 and the Greysteel massacre the following year.\n\nRead more here: Loyalist paramilitary groups 'have 12,500 members'\n\nGlenn Quinn was beaten to death for passing a remark about the South East Antrim UDA.\n\nWhen his family appealed for help with the PSNI investigation, they were also threatened by the South East Antrim UDA.\n\n\"I personally have been threatened three times, my mother's been threatened... They're threatening to shoot a 76-year-old woman.\n\n\"And that's part and parcel of how this organisation operate, they try to put people in fear.\"\n\nGlenn Quinn's death shocked Carrickfergus and beyond, but many locals remain too scared to speak out.\n\nThe murder, they say, is what happens when a ruthless criminal gang is effectively out-of-control and perceives itself to be above the law.\n\n\"I want people to search their hearts,\" said Martin.\n\n\"Because, next time, and there will be a next time, it might be their brother, it might be their son, and I'd ask them to do something to stop this.\n\n\"To break the silence. And help us.\"",

I can't get my head around it.\n\n\"Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me.\"\n\nIn February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\n\"All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,\" he said.\n\nMr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge.\n\nThe TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death.\n\nSpeaking last year, he said: \"I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest.\n\nAn inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict.\n\nThree years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest.\n\nIn 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later.\n\nLast year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The firm is funding a marketing campaign, and is looking to sign up as many as 30,000 eligible drivers.\n\nA full-time driver over those six years could claim about \u00a325,000 in lost earnings, it added. The group action is aiming to bring a case to the High Court no later than the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThis is not the first time that London's black cabs have done battle with Uber, but today's announcement shows neither side have conceded defeat.\n\nThe proposed claim itself is huge - loss of earnings for up to 30,000 drivers for nearly 6 years - and comes at a time when London black cabs and private hire vehicle drivers are struggling for work after nearly a year of lockdowns and restrictions.\n\nUber might now have its licence back, but the black cabs aren't willing to give them an easy ride.\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman said: \"Uber operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded.\n\n\"We are proud to serve this great global city and the 45,000 drivers in London who rely on the app for earnings opportunities, and are committed to helping people move safely.\"\n\nUber has had a torrid history in the UK capital including previous lawsuits.\n\nIn February 2019 cab drivers lost a legal challenge which argued that Uber's London operating licence was granted by a biased judge.\n\nUber then went on to lose its licence to operate in London in November 2019 after safety concerns.\n\nBut in September last year it was spared a London ban after a judge upheld an appeal against Transport for London's decision over safety.",

            "section": "Scotland",
            "content": "Hairdressers and garden centres will be allowed to reopen in Scotland from 5 April, days after the \"stay at home\" lockdown order will be lifted.\n\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\n\nThat date will also see all shops, gyms and tourist accommodation reopen, as well as some indoor hospitality.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that \"brighter days are ahead of us\".\n\nThe \"stay at home\" order, which has been in place since December, will be lifted on 2 April - although Ms Sturgeon said people would be encouraged to \"stay local\" for a further three weeks.\n\nOther changes - including the reopening of hairdressers, click and collect services and homeware shops and the resumption of outdoor contact sports for 12 to 17-year-olds - will be phased in from 5 April.\n\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\n\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including \"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\" - by mid-April.\n\nShe said this would \"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\n\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date, and that:\n\nA decision has not yet been taken on whether people will be allowed to meet indoors from 26 April, with Ms Sturgeon saying the situation would be kept \"under ongoing review\".\n\nShe told MSPs that four people from two households would be allowed to meet indoors from 17 May at the latest.\n\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\n\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like \"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\" - would involve \"plucking it out of thin air\".\n\nHowever, she said she was \"optimistic\" that these things could be possible by summer, particularly as the vaccine programme continues.\n\n\"This is certainly the most hopeful I have felt about the situation for a long time,\" she said.\n\nRestrictions on journeys between Scotland and other parts of the UK are likely to be lifted on 26 April, or \"as soon as possible thereafter\".\n\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that international travel would not be possible until at least mid-May due to the risk of importing new cases of the virus.\n\nShe said that \"our view is that it may well not be possible for a further period after that\" - and that pre-departure and post-arrival testing would likely remain in place \"for some time to come\".\n\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the statement was overdue, but welcome.\n\nHowever, she said there had been no mention of measures like reopening more court services and certain NHS treatments.\n\nAnd she called for the reopening of gyms to be brought forward so women in particular can \"get out of the house and do basic exercise without fear\".\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the current lockdown must be the last one, and that the government needed \"effective testing and tracing\" systems to keep infections low.\n\nHe called for more backing for businesses to recover from the pandemic, saying that \"transitional support must be available over the longer term to avoid businesses having to close\".\n\nData not dates was to be the key to lockdown easing in Scotland.\n\nThe first minister now seems confident enough in the trend in coronavirus suppression data to give indicative dates for when traditional freedoms should be restored.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson did this a few weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon was criticised by some for being overly cautious and insufficiently optimistic.\n\nToday, there's caution still - all easing depends on keeping down the virus and keeping up the vaccination programme.\n\nBut the first minister said this was the \"most hopeful\" she had felt for a long time and that \"something much closer to actual normality\" might be achieved as we move into summer.\n\nThe change in tone feels significant and this timetable comes just a week before the first anniversary of the original lockdown.\n\nMs Sturgeon said the government had to make \"careful, cautious, sensible and sometime unpopular decisions\" to make sure the exit from lockdown kept moving \"steadily and in one direction\".\n\nThe final payments of a range of business support grants are due to be paid in March and April, but Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the \"need for medium term-support\". She said the government had continued rates relief for the worst-hit sectors for the whole of the coming financial year.\n\nScottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the lifting of restrictions was \"most welcome for everyone\", but voiced a concern about a slight increase in daily cases and called for more testing on university and college campuses.\n\nMs Sturgeon said that \"any time we open up and people start to come together there is greater opportunity for transmission\", and that \"we need to get all of the pieces of this in balance as much as we can\".\n\nScottish Lib Dem Willie Rennie pressed for more information about the \"indicators that will allow people to understand when they will be moving from one level to the next in their area\".\n\nThe first minister said everything was \"predicated on the data going in the right direction\", and that \"all bets are off\" if case numbers rise sharply again.\n\nShe told MSPs that her \"hope and ambition\" was that all of Scotland could be in level one by early June, and then the bottom tier - level zero - from the end of that month.",

Not everyone has a bank account and not everyone can use digital,\" she said.\n\n\"Cash allows you to budget to the last penny. Fewer ATMs, bank branch closures and shops going cashless may be seen as progress to some, but there are still a lot of people out there where it makes life more difficult, expensive and uncertain.\"",

There has been no change to this plan.\"\n\nHowever, the industry is warning thousands of weddings will have to be cancelled or postponed following this \"confusion\".\n\n\"The roadmap indicated weddings and receptions could resume on 12th April. We have now discovered, not by being offered the information but by analysing the small print and repeatedly seeking clarity, that this is not the case,\" said Sarah Haywood, spokeswoman for Weddings Taskforce, a group set up to represent the sector.\n\nShe said 70% of England's weddings took place in licensed venues that would not be permitted to open under the rules, but that the government had failed to explain that clearly when it outlined its plan for reopening the economy in February.\n\nWeddings Taskforce estimates around 7,000 couples will be affected.\n\nWhen the country first went into lockdown last year, Hannah Graham and Joe Higgs, from Bedford, realised it was inevitable their April wedding would be postponed.\n\nBut after a lot of stops and starts in between, they thought they'd finally got the go ahead for a small wedding with 15 guests this April.\n\n\"There was no suggestion it was going to be limited to certain locations,\" says Hannah. \"If we'd been made aware at that point, we could have worked around it.\"\n\nThe wedding venue and the registrar who would marry them were happy with the booking, so they printed invitations with new dates.\n\n\"It looked like it was going ahead, so we got the ball rolling,\" says Joe. \"Now we've had to stop it and roll it in another direction.\"\n\nThey'll be paying more rebooking fees on top of the \u00a3300 they've already parted with over the past year.\n\n\"There's a part of us just wants to go to Gretna Green,\" he says.",

            "content": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\n\n\"Listen to the regulators\", Health Secretary Matt Hancock urges and tells people to \"get the jab\" as soon as they get the opportunity. He insists the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe after some European nations paused its use amid concern over blood clots. The UK's medicines watchdog, the MHRA, says evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots but some 13 countries have suspended use of the vaccine while they seek further clarification on its safety.\n\nA government scheme to house rough sleepers during the pandemic \"exposed the scale\" of the issue, say MPs. More than 37,000 people were taken off the streets by January 2021 as part of the Everyone In initiative, brought in due to Covid. This was praised by the Public Accounts Committee which said the number was nearly nine times official estimates of rough sleepers, showing a \"much larger\" issue than the government had \"acknowledged\". The government says it has \"ambitious plans\" to end rough sleeping.\n\nThe government's programme to help pupils who have missed school time catch up may not be reaching the most disadvantaged children, a report says. The National Tutoring Programme was launched last year to give extra tuition to the UK's poorest pupils and so far the Department for Education said it has invested \u00a32bn to help pupils. However, fewer than half of pupils who have already received tuition as part of the scheme are from the poorest families, a National Audit Office report found.\n\nWithdrawals from cash machines in the UK have fallen by \u00a337bn during the 12 months of the Covid pandemic, renewing the debate over the future of cash. Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, says the number of visits to ATMs has fallen by 43% compared with the previous 12 months. But the amount withdrawn on each cash machine visit has gone up, from an average of \u00a367 to \u00a384. Less demand and Covid restrictions mean 4,000 fewer free ATMs are in operation.\n\nDoctors and nurses in intensive care departments have shared their experiences throughout the pandemic, but what of the army of staff who have worked behind the scenes to keep hospitals running?

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "P&O Cruises says travellers will need vaccinations\n\nCruises were first paused in March due to the coronavirus pandemic\n\nP&O Cruises has said that anyone wanting to take its cruises around the British Isles this summer will need to be vaccinated first.\n\nTravellers will have to prove that they have had two coronavirus jabs to take the trips which depart from June.\n\nSaga Cruises and Virgin Voyages in the US have made similar moves recently.\n\nIt comes amid renewed fears about the damaged travel industry, with airports warning that summer 2020 passenger numbers were their lowest since 1975.\n\nP&O Cruises, which is part of the Carnival group, will run trips on two ships this summer. The Britannia will cruise from Southampton along the south coast of England for three or four days, and the Iona will travel up to Scotland from Southampton for seven-day trips.\n\nCarnival said that passengers wishing to board would have to have had both vaccination jabs at least a week before departure.\n\nGuests will also have to have travel insurance that \"must include medical and repatriation cover\" and medical expenses related to Covid-19.\n\nGuests and crew will be expected to respect social distancing rules and wear masks when appropriate.\n\nAnd should anyone test positive on board, they will be isolated and quarantined.\n\nPaul Ludlow, the president of P&O Cruises, said Carnival expected a government-approved way to prove people had been vaccinated by the summer.\n\n\"This is moving at pace,\" he said. \"We anticipate by the 27 June, which is our first sailing, there will be a government-accredited scheme to prove your vaccination, but at the very least, then of course, a letter from your GP would suffice.\"\n\nHe said that P&O Cruises was \"in close conversation with government every day\" about travellers being able to prove their vaccination status.\n\n\"At the moment we're stipulating that all guests of all ages must be vaccinated to come on board with us,\" Mr Ludlow added.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport said it was leading efforts \"to develop a framework that can safely facilitate international travel when the time is right, while still managing the risk from imported cases and variants\".\n\nCarnival follows Saga cruises, which said in January that all customers had to be vaccinated. British Airways also plans to let people register when they have had two vaccinations on a smartphone app.\n\nCarnival has not run cruises for a year due to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe cruise industry was brought to its knees after regulators around the world stopped ships from sailing to try to limit outbreaks.\n\nThere were a number of deaths from Covid-19 after people were infected on board Carnival ships early last year. The first UK citizen to die of coronavirus was infected on the Carnival-run Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\n\nAt the time, the outbreak on the ship was the largest outside mainland China, with more than 600 people infected.\n\nSimon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, said \"a lot is unusual\" about the \"staycation\" cruises P&O is planning.\n\n\"Because the voyages are 'cruises to nowhere', the captains will look at the weather forecast and aim to sail where it is warm and sunny,\" he said.\n\nHe added the P&O concept is \"you can look but you can't touch\".\n\n\"On a voyage around the Scottish islands, for example, Iona will anchor off Iona, the magical island after which she was named, but you can't step ashore,\" he said.\n\nDoing this circumvents all kinds of problems, he said.\n\n\"There are concerns about shore excursions. Some ports of call may not welcome hundreds of people from a wide range of locations wandering around, and conversely some cruise lines do not want their passengers to mingle with locals - MSC Cruises has made it a condition of travel,\" he said.\n\nCarnival has been burning through cash and last quarter said it had made a net loss of $2.2bn.\n\nAirport operators have also been on the ropes due to the coronavirus crisis. They said on Wednesday that passenger numbers travelling through UK airports last summer plunged to their lowest level since 1975.\n\n\"Despite dealing with the biggest crisis in their history, most airports remain operational to support vital public services, such as Royal Mail, air ambulances, Coastguard and the National Police Air Service, as well as other critical services such as freight, including PPE and vaccines,\" she said.\n\nThe Unite union also called for tailored support, saying that more than 5,100 UK aviation and related jobs have been lost every month since February 2020.\n\nUnite assistant general secretary for transport Diana Holland said: \"It has been heart-breaking to see so many UK jobs go in aviation when we know that demand will come back.\n\n\"A staggering number of workers in the sector are now unemployed but when we look across the Channel, we see that a different approach from governments actually saves these jobs.\"\n\nThe government has previously said that it has provided unprecedented support to businesses across sectors of the economy including aviation.\n\nA spokesperson told the BBC the government was committed to restarting cruise travel when it is safe to do so, and is working closely with the sector to prepare for a safe and successful restart.\n\n\"We have put in place an unprecedented package of business support and recently extended government-backed loans and furlough payments to businesses, including in the travel industry.\n\n\"Around \u00a37bn has been pledged to the aviation sector since the start of the pandemic, and through the Global Travel Taskforce we are working hard to restart international travel when it is safe to do so,\" the spokesperson said.",

            "content": "Conservative MP David Davis has used parliamentary privilege to criticise the Scottish government's handling of allegations against Alex Salmond.\n\nThe former minister told MPs during a Commons debate that there had been a \"concerted effort\" by SNP officials to encourage complainers to come forward.\n\nMr Davis also suggested Scottish government officials knew earlier than previously acknowledged of the claims.\n\nA spokesman for Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed the allegations.\n\nMr Davis accused the Scottish government of ignoring its own procedures and \"actively withholding information\" from the Holyrood inquiry which has been tasked with looking at the issue.\n\nDuring the debate he also said: \"I have it on good authority that there exists from 6th Feb 2018 an exchange of messages between civil servants suggesting that the first minister's chief of staff is interfering in the complaints process against Alex Salmond.\n\n\"If true this suggests the chief of staff had knowledge of the case in February, not April as she has claimed.\"\n\nMr Davis said he had been passed messages from the telephone of a senior SNP official by a whistleblower.\n\nHe read some of the messages out in the Commons and said they \"show that there is a concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" after the criminal investigation into Mr Salmond had started.\n\nAlex Salmond took the Scottish government to court, and won, over its handling of harassment complaints against him\n\nThe intervention from Mr Davis came on the day a leading QC asked to examine the government's procedures - after it conceded its handling of complaints against Alex Salmond was \"unlawful\" - published her findings.\n\nLaura Dunlop made a range of recommendations about how complaints against serving ministers could be investigated but said probes concerning former ministers should be independent.\n\nMs Dunlop's report came ahead of two other keenly anticipated reports relating to the bungled civil action against Mr Salmond.\n\nA Holyrood inquiry into what went wrong and an independent investigation of whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code in her contact with her predecessor are both due to report back in the coming weeks.\n\nA spokesman for First Minister Ms Sturgeon said: \"As with Mr Salmond's previous claims and cherry picking of messages, the reality is very different to the picture being presented.\n\n\"Every message involving SNP staff has been seen by the committee previously. Their views have been widely reported as dismissive of them.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Holyrood inquiry committee published a further submission from a former government staffer, Lorraine Kay, supporting Mr Salmond's claims.\n\nThe former first minister has said he was passed the name of one of the complainers during the investigation, while meetings between himself and Ms Sturgeon were being arranged.\n\nMs Sturgeon has said she does not accept that this happened, but Ms Kay told MSPs that she was also told the name by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein.\n\nTwo other allies of the former first minster - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have also backed this account, which opposition MSPs say would be an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\".\n\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she believed Mr Salmond was already aware of who the complainers were, and that what was said to Mr Aberdein was \"a matter of contention\".",
