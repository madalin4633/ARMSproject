            "section": "Scotland politics",
            "content": "Deputy First Minister John Swinney has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood after MSPs rejected the motion by 65 to 57.\n\nThe vote was tabled by the Tories after a row over the government providing its legal advice to an inquiry committee.\n\nThe motion was voted down after the Greens sided with the SNP to dismiss the move as a political stunt.\n\nMr Swinney had agreed to publish \"key\" papers from the government's legal battle with Alex Salmond.\n\nHowever, the committee said it was \"not reassured\" that it had been given access to all the material it had asked for.\n\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the \"key legal advice the deputy first minister promised has not been provided\". Her party was backed by Labour and the Lib Dems.\n\nMr Swinney described the motion as \"entirely baseless\".\n\nThe row stems from the government's handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond, which it admitted had been unlawful after the former first minister launched a judicial review case at the Court of Session.\n\nA special parliamentary committee was set up to hold an inquiry into the affair. Members of the group asked for government legal advice relating to the case to be disclosed.\n\nMSPs - including the Greens - twice voted to underline this demand, but the government initially only provided access to a memo summarising some advice.\n\nAfter all opposition parties said they would back a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney if the papers were not handed over, he relented and the government published a series of documents.\n\nHowever the committee said it was \"frustrated\" by how the process had played out and the Tories pushed ahead with the confidence vote.\n\nMr Salmond was cleared of charges of sexual assault after a separate High Court trial in March of last year\n\nMs Davidson told MSPs that the committee had been \"hampered at every turn from receiving even basic information\".\n\nShe said the papers published contained \"damning revelations\", but argued that \"there still remain key omissions\".\n\nShe added: \"We know we won't win - the votes are there for the deputy first minister - but we believe it is important and right to put on record that this is no way for the government to treat this parliament.\"\n\nLabour's Jackie Baillie - a member of the inquiry committee - said it had been provided with \"partial information, delayed information and in some cases no information at all\".\n\nShe added: \"There is a pattern of behaviour here of obstruction, secrecy and contempt for the institution of this parliament.\"\n\nLib Dem MSP Alex-Cole Hamilton added that it was \"entirely due to the obstruction and sleight of hand employed by this administration that we have arrived at this point\".\n\nMr Swinney contended that the government had published the advice to counter \"outlandish allegations\" of conspiracy, and had provided everything the committee had asked for.\n\nHe said: \"We have taken the extraordinary and unprecedented step of publishing formal legal advice of the kind that no previous government in Scotland has done.\n\n\"On any fair interpretation of what the government has done, the Tories' pursuit of this motion today is now entirely baseless.\n\n\"With an election only weeks away, the reality is, I suspect, that they were always intent on pushing this motion to a vote regardless of what action the government has taken.\"\n\nHe was backed by Patrick Harvie, who said the inquiry had \"descended into political farce\".\n\nThe Green co-leader said the process had become \"shabby political theatre\", with opposition members chiefly interested in \"winning a political scalp\".\n\nThe vote is the second time in the past year Mr Swinney has survived a confidence motion, with the Greens also backing him in his post as education secretary in a row over exam results.",

            "section": "London",
            "content": "A serving Met police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the disappearance of Sarah Everard.\n\nMs Everard, 33, was last seen a week ago in Clapham, south London, on her way home from a friend's house.\n\nThe suspect, in his 40s, is an officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, the Met said.\n\nA woman, in her 30s, is also in custody after being arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\n\nThe Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found.\n\nHer cousin, Tom Everard, said the family want to \"focus on the facts as they emerge\".\n\n\"I want to encourage people to come forward with anything they might have, and to continue supporting the police investigation,\" the 36-year-old added.\n\n\"We have to believe Sarah will still be found and brought back safely.\"\n\nOfficers are currently searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford.\n\nThe arrested officer, who was initially held on suspicion of kidnap, is also being questioned about a separate allegation of indecent exposure.\n\nHe was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street, the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London.\n\nHe was off duty at the time of his arrest.\n\nSince last Wednesday, officers have visited more than 750 homes in the Clapham area and have received more than 120 phone calls from the public, the Met said.\n\nMarketing executive Ms Everard vanished on 3 March and was last captured on a doorbell camera walking alone along the A205 Poynders Road towards Tulse Hill at about 21:30 GMT.\n\nMs Everard's family previously said it was out of character for her to disappear.\n\nShe is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton - a journey which should have taken about 50 minutes.\n\nSpeaking after the arrest on Tuesday, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: \"The fact that the man who has been arrested is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.\"\n\nMs Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with Ms Everard and her friends and family.\n\nAfter the arrest the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\n\nThe IOPC said a mandatory referral was made in relation to the Met's actions after Ms Everard was reported missing.\n\nThis morning Mr Ephgrave described the arrest of a serving Met Police officer as both shocking and disturbing.\n\nThat officer has now been further arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nIt's unusual for such a senior officer to give a statement at this stage of an investigation and perhaps reflects the horror felt within the force - a profession where colleagues often describe themselves as family.\n\nWe have now learnt the arrested officer is in his 40s and works in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was to patrol diplomatic premises.\n\nUnderstandably, Sarah's disappearance has made some people in and around Clapham nervous for their own safety.\n\nSocial media users have said the arrest of a police officer has heightened anxiety.\n\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: \"All women and girls should be able to feel safe on the streets of London at all times.\n\n\"I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah's disappearance and the developments in the case.\"\n\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Uber and rival app Lyft plan to share with each other the names of US drivers they ban from their platforms because of \"serious\" safety incidents, such as sexual assault.\n\nThe two firms said the programme, to be managed by a background check company, was aimed at improving industry safety.\n\nThey said other US firms could opt to participate.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft have faced scrutiny and legal action over their handling of sexual assault and other safety issues.\n\nThey have responded to the criticism by introducing measures such as recurring background checks and new features, such as emergency buttons in their apps.\n\nThe new programme, which is only active in the US, will also allow the two firms to share information about drivers involved in certain serious incidents such as rape and non-consensual kissing, as well as non-sexual physical assaults.\n\nScott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, said the effort meant \"perpetrators will no longer be able to hide or escape accountability by simply switching ridesharing platforms\".\n\n\"By putting aside competition, they are placing users first and building a safer rideshare community for all,\" he said in the announcement shared by the companies on Thursday.\n\nLawyer Kristen Barton of Estey & Bomberger, which represents women who have sued the ridesharing companies for inadequate protections from sexual violence, called the programme a \"step in the right direction\".\n\nBut she cautioned that the database's usefulness would be limited by its focus on drivers that the companies have banned.\n\n\"There's no guarantee that when a report against a driver is lodged that that is being followed up on and resulting in deactivation by the companies,\" she said, adding that only a small number of people who are assaulted even report the incident.\n\n\"While it is a good start, it's just not going to capture enough information to stop assaults from occurring,\" she said.\n\nIn 2019, Uber said it had received nearly 6,000 reports of sexual assault in the US in the previous two years. It said problems arose in a tiny fraction of the 2.3 billion rides during that time.\n\nIt later clashed with state regulators in California, who wanted access to the reports, ultimately leading to a fine.\n\nLyft has delayed publication of a similar report, citing the privacy disagreement. The company is also facing lawsuits from dozens of women in the US, who say they were harmed after the firm failed to protect passengers from its drivers.\n\nLyft is active in the US and Canada. Uber, which operates in 71 countries around the world, said the data-sharing initiative was limited to the US, with no plans to expand at this time.\n\nThe firm has faced concerns over its handling of safety incidents outside the US as well.\n\nIn the UK, Uber had its London licence suspended, in part because of safety concerns. However, in September last year, Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled the firm could continue operating, saying it had improved its record despite \"historical failings\".",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "Two UK internet providers have been helping the Home Office and National Crime Agency track the websites visited by customers.\n\nA trial of new powers granted by the controversial Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 has been going on for months.\n\nIt involves the internet providers creating internet connection records (ICRs), which can be used to show which websites a person visited and when.\n\n\"It's needles in haystacks, and this is collecting the entire haystack,\" said Heather Burns, policy manager with the Open Rights Group.\n\n\"We should have the right to not have every single click of what we do online hoovered up into a surveillance net on the assumption that there might be criminal activity taking place.\"\n\nThe Home Office said the trial was small in scale and in its early stages.\n\nIt is exploring what kind of data could be retrieved under the law and how useful - or not - it might be, it said.\n\nBut due to the nature of the trial, its exact workings are shrouded in secrecy, and it is not clear how many internet records are being collected for testing purposes, or to whom they belong.\n\nThe test's existence was first reported by Wired.\n\nThe power to spy on the websites people visit comes from the Investigatory Powers Act, which critics call a \"snoopers' charter\" due to widespread concerns about its scope.\n\nThe act gives the secretary of state the power, with a judge's approval, to order internet providers to keep their records for up to a year. The definition is so broad that critics believe all ISPs will simply be issued with such orders to cover all their customers.\n\nThose records can include which websites a customer visits, when, and how much data they download, as well as the relevant IP (internet protocol) addresses - but not what pages or exactly what content they read on those sites.\n\nBut that so-called \"metadata\" can still reveal a lot about a person's habits - from what political sites they visit to their use of pornography. There are, however, restrictions on who can access the ICRs and for what reasons.\n\nThe trial involves the two UK internet providers, which have not been named, the Home Office, and the National Crime Agency.\n\nThe internet providers themselves are prevented from saying if they are involved, as the law bans \"disclosing\" the existence of a data retention notice to anyone else.\n\nThe trial's existence was never formally announced or publicised, but was instead contained in two short paragraphs in a 168-page annual report from the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (Ipco), published in December.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ipco said the trial was continuing, and \"regular reviews\" were being carried out to make sure the data collection was \"necessary and proportionate\".\n\n\"Once a full assessment of the trial has been carried out, a decision will be made on whether there is a case for national rollout,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms Burns said the level of secrecy involved was a cause for concern.\n\n\"Yes, they're ticking the boxes about the oversight and the judicial approval every way they can,\" she said.\n\n\"But there's still an aspect of transparency which is crucially missing here.\"\n\nShe said questions remained around the scope of the law, which had been a key concern for critics as it was being debated in Parliament.\n\nThe Ipco report's brief reference to the trial revealed that it began in July 2019, when a judge approved a \"retention notice\" on a telecoms company. Another was granted in October that year, for a different telecoms company.\n\nBoth are, it said, for \"testing purposes only\" - so it is not clear whether they are linked to criminal suspects.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said it uses what it calls \"data exploitation\" to tackle crime.\n\n\"We are supporting the Home-Office-sponsored trial of internet connection record capability to determine the technical, operational, legal and policy considerations associated with delivery of this capability,\" it said in a statement.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Retail giant John Lewis has warned of further \"painful\" store closures after the pandemic saw it report its first ever annual loss.\n\nThe group swung to a loss of \u00a3517m for the year to January, against profits of \u00a3146m the previous year.\n\nThe retailer said it \"does not expect\" all of its department stores to reopen once lockdown restrictions ease.\n\nIt has previously been reported the chain was considering closing up to eight more stores to try to cut costs.\n\nAny further closures would be in addition to eight already announced in 2020.\n\nThe firm, which has 42 John Lewis shops, said talks with landlords are ongoing and it will make a final decision about the \"small number\" of shops to close at the end of March.\n\nThe rise in internet shopping, accelerated by various lockdown measures during the pandemic, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs.\n\nIt said that before last March, every \u00a36 in \u00a310 spent on its websites was driven by its shops. That figure is now just \u00a33 in \u00a310.\n\nChairman Sharon White told the BBC that the decision to close stores was \"painful\" but necessary due to a \"decade of changes in shopping habits in one year\".\n\n\"There is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store,\" she added.\n\n\"Regrettably, we do not expect to reopen all our John Lewis shops at the end of lockdown, which will also have implications for our supply chain.\"\n\nShe said John Lewis would do everything it could \"to lessen the impact\", but she added: \"We want to ensure our stores reflect how customers want to shop - 'right space, right place'.\"\n\nSharon White landed in the driving seat just weeks before the pandemic and swiftly had to make some tough decisions - closing stores, slashing jobs and cutting costs. She also had to tell partners that for the first time in more than 50 years they wouldn't receive their much cherished annual bonus.\n\nThese past 12 months have clearly focused minds on how many big department stores it needs.\n\nDespite lockdown restrictions, John Lewis sales were flat last year. In other words, it managed to transfer all those lost sales from the High Street to online. Its website business was already strong and it predicts 70% of sales will be online from 2025.\n\nBut another raft of store closures is a real blow for the towns they're based in. Some will think it's going too far - that there could be an opportunity for it to add sales, given that so many of its rivals have either beaten a retreat or disappeared altogether.\n\nJohn Lewis went on a big expansion spree back in 2007, almost doubling the number of stores in its portfolio. As sad as it is, it's now set to rein those numbers in.\n\nJohn Lewis' hefty annual loss was mainly due to the write-down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs.\n\nThe group announced last July it was closing John Lewis stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras station and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs.\n\nIn September, John Lewis also announced it was scrapping its staff bonus for the first time since 1953.\n\nThe partnership, which also runs Waitrose supermarkets, is now targeting savings of \u00a3300m a year by 2022.\n\nDavid Cartmell lost his job as a stock manager at the John Lewis store in Birmingham last year\n\nDavid Cartmell took great pride in working at the John Lewis store in Birmingham until it closed last year and he was made redundant.\n\nHe says the news of further store closures on Thursday came as \"little surprise\".\n\n\"I always knew the original eight store closures, including my branch were just the tip of the iceberg,\" the former stock manager says.\n\nOne of the groups' big problems, David says, is its past expansion strategy: \"We were trying to make the chain as common as Debenhams.\"\n\nAs overheads including bills, rents, salaries and bonuses mounted, he says the group became a \"victim\" of its own previous marker of success.\n\n\"We were trying to use an old business model to keep up our biggest competitors such as Amazon in a digital age.\"\n\nNow, he feels \"absolutely sorry\" for the workers waiting to hear the fate of their own stores.\n\nIn addition to closing some John Lewis stores, the group is trialling running dedicated John Lewis shopping areas in some Waitrose supermarkets.\n\nWaitrose benefitted from a jump in demand for online deliveries as people sought to minimise trips to the supermarket. John Lewis said the Waitrose website was taking about 240,000 orders a week, and now \"stands as a \u00a31bn sales business\".\n\nThe increased demand for groceries, however, did not offset the problems at the group's department stores.\n\nAs a result, John Lewis confirmed that it would not return the business rates relief it has received from government during the Covid crisis.\n\nIt said it had claimed \u00a3190m in combined rates relief and support under the furlough scheme, and that it would claim business rates relief between April and June.\n\nIt said the holiday from the tax levied on non-domestic properties had helped it avoid \"a more severe restructuring of the partnership, which would have put more jobs at risk at a time when the High Street is already under pressure\".\n\n\"We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain,\" it added.\n\nGrocers such as Morrisons, Tesco and Asda said in December that they would return more than \u00a31.7bn in rates relief. This came after supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, were criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders.",

            "content": "LGBT+ campaigners have urged the government to \"make good\" the prime minister's promise to ban \"conversion therapy\" in England and Wales.\n\nIt comes as three advisers quit the government's LGBT+ advisory panel amid concern it is being too slow in bringing in legislation.\n\nMinisters have promised to \"work at pace\" to end conversion therapy.\n\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had a \"blind spot\" on the issue that the PM had to \"address\".\n\nConversion therapy involves treatments ranging from psychotherapy to religious teaching and discussion.\n\nCampaigners want a \"meaningful\" law against the practice, which aims to change sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nAll forms of conversion therapy are already prohibited in Switzerland and parts of Australia and Boris Johnson pledged last summer to ban what he called an \"abhorrent\" practice in England and Wales.\n\nBut the government has not yet published the findings of a consultation on the issue which began in 2018.\n\nIn a debate in Parliament on Monday, equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said conversion therapy had \"no place in a civilised society\", but added that \"robust\" laws were already in place to deal with the most troubling examples, involving violence and sexual assault.\n\nAnd the government did not want to stop those who \"seek spiritual counselling as they explore their sexual orientation\", she said.\n\nBut LGBT+ groups and campaigners, including Stonewall, the LGBT Foundation and Trans Media Watch, say a ban on all forms of conversion therapy, not just the most distressing types, is needed.\n\nIn a letter to Ms Badenoch, they express \"deep concern\" over her comments, arguing they appeared to \"imply that you have been meeting with perpetrators of conversion therapy and those who want the practice to continue\".\n\nThe letter continues: \"This is very worrying and gives the impression that the government is more interested in appeasing the extreme fringes of religious people, despite the calls for a ban from senior religious leaders from across a wide range of faiths.\"\n\nTwo advisers quit the government's LGBT advisory panel on Wednesday, and a third resigned on Thursday.\n\nThere have been rumblings for a while about a growing unease amongst some panel members which are now playing out in a very public way.\n\nThe advisory group was first set up under Theresa May but hasn't met for some time - I'm told at least six months.\n\nAnd now we've heard claims that, even when it did meet, panellists didn't necessarily feel listened to.\n\nIf the group does appear increasingly defunct (and we'll have to see what happens) it may be seen, by some, as symbolic of a fading commitment to LGBT+ equality under this administration.\n\nMinisters would reject that and, during a debate on Monday, Kemi Badenoch said the government has a \"proud record\" of championing equal opportunity.\n\nBut it was her response overall that seems to have sparked these resignations.\n\nAmong concerns was her refusal to commit to a legislative \"ban\" of so-called conversion therapy, promising instead only to \"end\" the practice.\n\nThe equalities minister described the legal landscape as \"complex\". But it's an awkward one for Boris Johnson who did, last summer, use the word \"ban\" during a TV interview.\n\nJayne Ozanne, who resigned first, accused ministers of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT+ people.\n\nShe said there had been \"a lack of engagement\", telling ITV News that both Ms Badenoch and minister for women and equalities Liz Truss were known among the LGBT+ community as \"the ministers for inequality\".\n\nAnother of those who quit the panel, James Morton, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"For the past 12 months I've been increasingly concerned about the direction of travel on trans rights.\"\n\nHe added that it felt \"really scary\" being a trans person \"in the UK at the moment\".\n\nAnd Ellen Murray said she had resigned \"due to the government's persistent and worsening hostility towards our community\".\n\n\"From conversion therapy to trans healthcare, to the shameful treatment of LGBT refugees, the government has acted in appalling faith,\" she added.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government \"has a blind\" spot in the issue.\n\n\"The PM needs to address what is obviously a problem in his government and a pattern of behaviour he needs to address,\" he said at his party's local election campaign launch.\n\nAsked if he would ban conversion therapy if he were prime minister, Sir Keir said: \"yes, absolutely.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government \"bows to nobody in terms of our pushing for LBTQ issues, LGBT rights and also rights of minorities\".\n\nOn Wednesday, a government spokesman said: \"We have repeatedly made clear that we will take action to end conversion therapy and we are working to bring forward plans to do so shortly.\"\n\nThe LGBT Advisory Council was set up in 2019, with the term of current panel members set to end on 31 March.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Heathrow Airport regularly sees queues of three hours and sometimes six hours at border control, according to Emma Gilthorpe, its chief operating officer.\n\nEarlier this month, passengers complained of waiting up to seven hours, which one said was \"inhumane\".\n\nBut Border Force said many passengers were arriving without having bought mandatory Covid testing packages.\n\nThe enforcement body added that people should only be travelling for limited reasons.\n\nSeparately, hundreds of Heathrow passport control are set to take industrial action.\n\nUnions representing Border Force officials said the delays were partly caused by Covid restrictions requiring immigration officials to work in a bubble of 10.\n\nThey said this prevented more staff being deployed if the border was particularly busy.\n\nBut Nick Jariwalla, director of Border Force at Heathrow, said: \"We are in a global health pandemic - it is illegal to go on holiday and people should only be travelling for very limited reasons.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a large number of passengers are continuing to arrive without having purchased their mandatory testing packages for the second and eighth days of quarantine in the UK.\n\n\"This causes delays as passengers may receive a fine or be subject to other enforcement action.\"\n\nMr Jariwalla said all arriving passengers had to purchase the testing package before leaving the airport.\n\n\"We make absolutely no apologies for this,\" he added. \"Every essential check stops the spread of coronavirus in the UK.\n\n\"These people should not have been allowed to travel without their testing packages and we are following up with regulators and carriers to ensure the law is enforced.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Ms Gilthorpe said that pre-Covid, the queues for EU arrivals were supposed to be 25 minutes, and 45 minutes for non-EU arrivals.\n\nWhile she said she expected the length of waiting to go up during the pandemic, Ms Gilthorpe said the levels the airport was currently seeing were \"unacceptable\".\n\nWhile Ms Gilthorpe said the measures in place for quarantine hotels were running relatively smoothly, with a small number of passengers, she said the same could not be said for the border.\n\n\"We are seeing significant pressure on the border and we are seeing very long queues, and that is a worry,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Ms Gilthorpe said she knew additional resources had been introduced, the issues were caused by \"the level of complexity of the processes and the way resource is being deployed\".\n\nInternational arrivals must now provide proof of a negative Covid test taken 72 hours before departure to England and a passenger locator form which contains details of either a purchased hotel quarantine stay, or two test kits for at home quarantine.\n\nShe told the committee: \"It is deeply frustrating as the operator of the airport when you have a queue full of people and you only have two desks open.\n\n\"It is rare to see all the desks manned and we have to find our way to how we make that happen so we can get that flow.\"\n\nHeathrow's self-service e-gates at passport control are currently closed.\n\nMs Gilthorpe said she hoped that by the summer, the gates would also be able to scan passenger locator forms and pre-departure testing results, but that had not yet been integrated into the system.\n\nThe Heathrow executive also warned that if the long queues continued after international travel is permitted. it could risk the country's economic resurgence.\n\n\"Heathrow is Britain's hub airport, it is the front door. We have to get our economy moving and we have to make sure we are capable of receiving people,\" she said.\n\n\"If you have a poor experience at the border, there's a risk you won't come back again. That traffic will go to Charles De Gaulle [airport in Paris], it will go to Frankfurt and we will miss out on that economic resurgence,\" she said.\n\nThe queue delays come as staff in the PCS union served notice of industrial action over rosters they describe as \"unworkable\".\n\nThis will involve a month of action short of a strike by hundreds of staff, including working to rule and an overtime ban.\n\nThe roster changes include ending the ability of staff to swap and request certain shifts, the union said.\n\nIn February, staff voted for strike action over the changes, the union said.",

            "content": "All of Scotland's 32 local authorities have frozen council tax rates at last year's levels.\n\nThe Scottish government offered councils incentives in return for not raising the cost of the bills.\n\nGlasgow and Stirling were the last authorities to consider council tax levels when they set their 2021/22 budgets on Thursday.\n\nOther councils had been through that process since last month, with all agreeing to a freeze.\n\nLocal authorities are to receive a cash equivalent of a 3% council tax increase in return for not putting up levels.\n\nThe move forms part of the Scottish government's spending plans for the coming year, which Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said were aimed at striking a balance between raising revenue to pay for public services and helping Scotland recover from the Covid pandemic.\n\nMs Forbes said she was pleased the freeze had been agreed by all the councils.\n\nShe said: \"With people facing unprecedented challenges and extra pressures, now is a time to work together to provide stability and certainty.\n\n\"I am pleased that councils have taken advantage of this additional support and have protected household finances. This will make a real difference to people across Scotland.\"\n\nPoints to note: Band D is highlighted above as the average council tax bill for householders in Scotland. The Band D figures do not include water and sewerage charges. Therefore, the final household bill will be bigger.\n\nIt will come as a relief to the Scottish government when they are finally able to confirm that council tax bills will not rise anywhere in Scotland this year.\n\nThe SNP believes it will be a popular measure at a time when some families are facing financial pressures because of the pandemic.\n\nSo it will be a relief for the government - but no real surprise.\n\nIf any council were to decide to put up the council tax, the rise would need to be significant to be worthwhile. This is because they would have lost out on some government funding if they put up bills.\n\nThe Scottish government will be hopeful that a new council tax freeze proves as popular with the public as they think the first one did.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2017 the basic council tax rate didn't rise anywhere in Scotland. Since then councils have been able to put it up within agreed limits, though it's worth noting that some still opted for lower rises and even freezes.\n\nThe basic argument between some in local government and Holyrood is not over whether voters will welcome another freeze - most accept they will. The argument is over whether councils have enough money overall and if they are too dependent on government cash.\n\nMost council income either comes directly from the government or, like council tax, is heavily influenced by it.\n\nCouncils had already been given extra government money to cope with the pandemic but have also lost income - sports centres have been closed, facilities cannot be hired out and they have lost income from car parking.\n\nThe underlying issue is whether the council tax itself is fit for purpose and whether councils should have a broader range of ways to raise finances.\n\nFourteen years ago when the SNP first took control of Holyrood, a council tax freeze was meant to be a temporary measure while a way to replace the council tax was found.\n\nFinding an alternative or finding palatable ways of giving councils more financial independence from central government is easier said than done.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Artist's impression of how the new mine will look\n\nA public inquiry has been announced into plans for the first new deep coal mine in the UK for decades.\n\nThe government had previously decided not to intervene in the project near Whitehaven in Cumbria, which was in the hands of local officials.\n\nBut ministers have taken control because of \"increased\" controversy.\n\nGreen campaigners say the mine will increase carbon emissions and send the wrong signal in the run-up to a UK-hosted climate conference in October.\n\nThe Woodhouse Colliery would extract coking coal for the steel industry from the seabed off St Bees, with a processing plant at Kells, in Whitehaven.\n\nCumbria County Council councillors, who have been assessing the project since 2017, gave it the go-ahead last March - but have since decided to review the application.\n\nLast month it was reported that the government's climate tsar, Alok Sharma, was apoplectic the plans for the coal mine had not been stopped.\n\nMr Sharma, who is in charge of preparations for the COP26 UN climate conference, has faced calls to resign over the issue.\n\nHe told MPs only last month that the mine was a \"local issue\" and would be decided by the council.\n\nBut the government has now decided to \"call in\" the application, meaning Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick will get the final say over it.\n\nIn a letter to Cumbria County Council, Mr Jenrick said the application had raised issues of \"more than local importance\".\n\nHe added the reversal had also been prompted by new advice on carbon emissions from government climate advisers published in December.\n\nHowever, a public inquiry will first be held by independent planners at the Planning Inspectorate. The inquiry process could take a number of months.\n\nAsked on Friday whether the government backed the mine or not, Boris Johnson said he couldn't get involved as it was now a \"qausi-judicial planning decision\".\n\nMP Trudy Harrison, whose Copeland constituency would include the mine, is a ministerial aide to the prime minister and has described opponents of the mine as being in \"cloud cuckoo land\".\n\nMs Harrison has yet to comment on the decision to hold an inquiry, but the Tory MP for nearby Workington, Mark Jenkinson, called the decision a \"capitulation to climate alarmists\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cumbria, he said the \"screeching U-turn\" could open a \"Pandora's box\" over how the UK's contribution to climate change is measured.\n\nHe added there was \"nothing on the horizon\" to replace coking coal in the process for making steel, a sector that is due to play an important role in the UK's \"green recovery\".\n\nThe government could still decide to approve the mine, but given the amount of anger it's caused that seems unlikely - at least until after the UN climate conference.\n\nLocal Conservatives strongly supported the scheme and the employment it would bring.\n\nBut the government's climate advisers, along with a crowd of green groups, warned it would increase carbon emissions when the UK's committed to cutting them.\n\nWhat's more, it would harm Britain's international reputation before the UN conference, they said.\n\nOne of the world's leading climate scientists, the American James Hansen, warned Boris Johnson risked humiliation over the mine.\n\nThe US climate envoy John Kerry warned against it on Monday. And yesterday Alok Sharma was again rebuked by MPs over the plan.\n\nIt was too much pressure.\n\nProf Rebecca Willis and Prof Mike Berners-Lee from Lancaster University say the mine would produce 8.4m tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to the emissions from more than a million households.\n\nSupporters of the mine say that by producing coal to be used in Europe, the mine will reduce emissions from shipping coal from Australia or the USA.\n\nBut the mine proposal comes at a time when the government wants every sector of the UK economy to reduce CO2 emissions - not find new sources of carbon.\n\nLabour's shadow environment secretary Ed Miliband said the government should \"block\" the mine and \"provide alternative jobs in the green industries of the future\".\n\n\"We owe people a long-term secure employment situation, the mine isn't the answer,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe added that whilst there was a \"current need\" for coking coal in steelmaking, \"all experts say over time the industry's going to need to move towards hydrogen as the answer\".\n\nLib Dem Tim Farron, MP for nearby Westmoreland and Lonsdale, said: \"In the year that Britain hosts COP26, it is blindingly obviously that we won't be taken seriously on the world stage with this coal mine hanging round our neck.\"\n\nHe added: \"I hope this public inquiry leads to these plans finally being axed, and the government instead looks at bringing well-paid, long-term, green jobs to Cumbria.\"",

            "content": "The executive director of an industry body for the UK press has resigned after a row over its reaction to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's comments about racism in the media.\n\nIan Murray said he would step down from his role at the Society of Editors so it could \"rebuild its reputation\".\n\nPrince Harry said some British tabloids were \"racist\" and \"bigoted\".\n\nThe Society of Editors initially denied that and said such an \"attack\" was \"not acceptable\" without providing evidence.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation on Wednesday, Mr Murray said: \"Since the statement was issued the SoE has been heavily criticised.\n\n\"While I do not agree that the society's statement was in any way intended to defend racism, I accept it could have been much clearer in its condemnation of bigotry and has clearly caused upset.\n\n\"As executive director I lead the society and as such must take the blame and so I have decided it is best for the board and membership that I step aside so that the organisation can start to rebuild its reputation.\"\n\nHe added that the original statement was \"not intended to gloss over the fact the media industry in the UK does have work to do on inclusivity and diversity\".\n\nIt comes after ITV presenter Charlene White pulled out as host of an awards ceremony staged by the Society of Editors - the British Press Awards - saying the organisation should find \"someone whose views align with yours\" to replace her.\n\nIn the duke and duchess' recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism.\n\nHe said that was a \"large part\" of why he and his wife had left the UK.\n\nThe duke recalled a conversation he had had at a charity fundraiser in which he was told that the UK is \"very bigoted\", and he said he replied: \"The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids.\"\n\nHe added: \"But unfortunately if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.\"\n\nThe Society of Editors, which represents almost 400 members of the media, put out a robust defence in response.\n\n\"The UK media is not bigoted and will not be swayed from its vital role holding the rich and powerful to account following the attack on the press by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,\" it said.\n\nAfter criticism, however, it put out a further statement on Wednesday to say its initial comments \"did not reflect what we all know: that there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion\".\n\nThe editors of the Guardian and HuffPost UK had both said they did not agree with the society's position.\n\nAlison Gow, president of the Society of Editors, said: \"I would like to thank Ian for his tireless work on behalf of the society; he has led campaigns for journalists' rights and freedoms and worked hard behind the scenes when it appeared legislation might threaten those.\n\n\"The society is committed to representing all journalists and upholding journalism; I am clear on what our mission must be, and we will strive as an organisation to listen and hear everyone's views, and be strong advocates and allies for all those we represent.\"",

We are working to bring forward plans to do so shortly.\"\n\nThere have been rumblings for a while about a growing unease among some panel members which are now playing out in a very public way.\n\nThe advisory group was first set up under Theresa May but hasn't met for some time - I'm told at least six months.\n\nAnd now we've heard claims that, even when it did meet, panellists didn't necessarily feel listened to.\n\nIf the group does appear increasingly defunct (and we'll have to see what happens) it may be seen, by some, as symbolic of a fading commitment to LGBT+ equality under this administration.\n\nMinisters would reject that and, during a debate on Monday, Kemi Badenoch said the government had a \"proud record\" of championing equal opportunity.\n\nBut it was her response overall that seems to have sparked these resignations.\n\nAmong concerns was her refusal to commit to a legislative \"ban\" on so-called conversion therapy, promising instead only to \"end\" the practice.\n\nThe equalities minister described the legal landscape as \"complex\". But it's an awkward one for Boris Johnson who did, last summer, use the word \"ban\" during a TV interview.\n\nWhen she resigned from her advisory role on Monday, Jayne Ozanne accused ministers of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT+ people.\n\nTwo others who then also quit the panel, James Morton, and Ellen Murray, said they also had concerns about the government's approach to conversion therapy and trans rights.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government \"has a blind\" spot in the issue.\n\n\"The PM needs to address what is obviously a problem in his government,\" he said at his party's local election campaign launch.\n\nAsked if he would ban conversion therapy if he were prime minister, Sir Keir replied: \"Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nThe LGBT Advisory Council was set up in 2019, with the term of current panel members set to end on 31 March.",

And now what we also know is that it seems to affect other parts of the body as well - the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and even the brain.\n\n\u201cSo researchers will be able to investigate the direct effects of coronavirus infection on changes in both the structure and the function of these organs.\u201d\n\nThe study will look at people with asymptomatic Covid, and others who had severe disease.\n\nBrain scans will also be carried out to try to aid understanding of long Covid.\n\n\u201cIt will enable researchers to investigate whether the effects of the virus on different organs of the body vary between how severe your infection was in the first place,\u201d explains Prof Allen.\n\nDetailed scans of 1,500 Biobank members who have not been infected will also be recorded.\n\nBrian Shepherd, 71, from Gateshead, is one of those taking part.\n\nIn November he spent five days in hospital after catching Covid.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing was when I got in the ambulance, with my wife standing on the pavement, and you think 'will I ever see her again?'.\"\n\nBut after five days of treatment, Brian was allowed home.

Scientists have discovered scarring on the lungs, inflammation and muscle damage of the heart, and kidney injuries.\n\nThe virus can also affect the brain, and some long Covid sufferers have said they are experiencing \u201cbrain fog\u201d - problems with memory and concentration, dizziness and depression.\n\nThe hope is the study could pinpoint some of the neurological changes that may have taken place.\n\nProf Paul Matthews, a neuroscientist from Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe brain scans can tell us more general things about the brain structure. Whether there's evidence for inflammation in the brain that may be persisting, and whether there's been damage enough to to actually kill nerve cells in the brain that may cause some shrinkage.\u201d\n\nThese scans will be repeated over the coming years - and made available to researchers all around the world.\n\nThe team says our understanding of the health legacy of Covid is just beginning.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

I have been self-policing since then, we moderate everything.\n\n\"Our clothing, our drinking, we get taxis where maybe we can't afford it, we hold keys between our fingers, we don't wear headphones when we're jogging, we stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting.\"\n\nAnother tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces has been liked more than 120,000 times.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the concerns shared by women \"are so powerful because each and every woman can relate\".\n\n\"Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence,\" she added.\n\nMaya Tutton, who created the Our Streets Now anti-harassment campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she first experienced harassment in public at the age of 12.\n\n\"What these incidents make you do is\u2026 that they make you fear going outside and they make you feel that you are not an equal citizen to your male counterparts and that you don't have those fundamental human rights to go about your everyday life without living in fear,\" the 22-year-old said.\n\n\"We're so at the end of our tether with violence against women and girls never being a priority and never being an issue that we put money and resources into tackling.\"\n\nMs Tutton added: \"By not putting the emphasis on the perpetrator and on really tackling that culture, what we're doing is we're not getting to the root of the problem - we are being forced to change our behaviour.\"\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said there should not be a message to women \"where we're told what to do or what we have to do\".\n\n\"The reality is that for most women they have had some sort of experience that they feel frightened of,\" she told the Today programme.\n\n\"Women aren't weak because of a fault in their personality, women are weak because of men's violence.\"\n\nAs part of an International Women's Day debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, she read out the names of 118 women who have died since this date last year - where a man had been charged or convicted as the primary perpetrator.\n\nIt took more than four minutes for her to do so.\n\nShe told MPs there was currently no government study into the patterns every year of women who are killed. \"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives - dead women is just one of those things.\"\n\nBut, she added: \"Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common. Dead women do count.\"\n\nMs Phillips concluded saying that the name of Sarah Everard, not included on the list, \"rings out across all of our media\". \"Let's pray every day and work every day so that nobody's name ends up on this list again,\" she said.\n\nJulie Bindel, a campaigner on women's issues since the 1970s, said: \"The message from wider society and from all police officers during these many operations on violence against women should be a message for men.\n\nShe praised a tweet from one man, Stuart Edwards, who asked if there were steps men could take to reduce women's anxiety.\n\nI live less than five minutes from where Sarah Everard went missing. Everyone is on high alert. Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor? \u2014 Stuart Edwards (@StuartEdwards) March 9, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter\n\nMarian FitzGerald, a visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, said while women's fear was real, statistics showed women were less likely to be murdered than men.\n\nShe said Ms Everard's disappearance \"shouldn't make women any more fearful than they already were\".\n\n\"Yes, the fear is real and it is always heightened when something like this is in the news. That doesn't mean to say that the risk has changed,\" she said.\n\n\"It hasn't changed much over many years. Women account for about a third of all murders. Men are far more likely to be murdered.\n\n\"Men are far more likely to be murdered by someone they don't know. Men are far more likely to be murdered in public places.\"\n\nAsked about young women who have said they should not have to be fearful, Ms FitzGerald said: \"In terms of the risk that we face, I know that the current situation is frightening... the reason why we remember these cases is because they are so rare and we should hold on to that.\"\n\nIn 2019-20, 71% of female murder victims were killed at home compared to 36% of male murder victims. Around one in 10 of female murder victims were killed on the streets.\n\nThe World Health Organization reported this week that one in three women across the world have been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.",

Mackenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has also signed up to the pledge and gave away more than $4bn of her fortune in just four months last year.\n\nThe fifth member of the exclusive cohort is LVMH's Bernard Arnault and his family.\n\nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerburg has just slipped out of the exclusive ranks, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list.\n\nMr Buffett's net worth comes almost entirely from owning about one-sixth of Berkshire Hathaway, a roughly $600bn company.\n\nIts share price is up 15% this year, surpassing $400,000 a share. The investment firm had been struggling in recent years to find deals to spark its growth given its sheer size.\n\nThe Omaha-based company is a major shareholder in Apple and other tech stocks that have seen their values surge during the pandemic.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway was a failing textile company before Mr Buffett took control of it 1965.

            "section": "Scotland politics",
            "content": "The law aims to give protection for individuals around their sexuality and gender identity, among other protected characteristics\n\nThe legislation consolidates existing law and extends protection for vulnerable groups with a new offence of \"stirring up hatred\".\n\nIt was passed by 82 votes to 32 a day later than expected, after MSPs ran out of time on Wednesday while debating a raft of amendments.\n\nOpponents of the bill said they still have concerns about a possible chilling of free speech.\n\nThere were four abstentions.\n\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: \"I am delighted Holyrood has backed this powerful legislation that is fitting for the Scotland we live in.\n\n\"Parliament has sent a strong and clear message to victims, perpetrators, communities and to wider society that offences motivated by prejudice will be treated seriously and will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill was first introduced last April in response to an independent review of Scotland's hate crime laws by Lord Bracadale, but has sparked fierce debate.\n\nUnder the bill, offences are considered \"aggravated\" - which could influence sentencing - if they involve prejudice on the basis of age, disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or variations in sex characteristics (sometimes described as \"intersex\" physical or biological characteristics).\n\nIt also creates new offences of \"stirring up hatred\" - which previously applied only to race - and abolishes the offence of blasphemy which has not been prosecuted in Scotland for more than 175 years.\n\nAn earlier draft of the bill was criticised by the Law Society of Scotland for having a perceived low threshold for prosecution.\n\nA number of groups including religious and cultural groups, writers, journalists, campaigners and police raised concerns about its impact on free expression.\n\nThe Scottish government responded by modifying the wording and strengthening freedom of expression provisions.\n\nThe changes meant \"stirring up hatred\" would only be considered an offence if it was intentional.\n\nOn Wednesday, two amendments designed to further strengthen the protection of free speech were passed unanimously by MSPs.\n\nDuring the final debate on Thursday, Humza Yousaf argued that those provisions were strong enough to prevent criminalisation.\n\nHe said: \"To those who think they may accidentally somehow fall foul of the law... because they believe sex is immutable, or they believe an adult man cannot become a female or they campaign for the rights of Palestinians... or those that proselytise that same-sex relationships are sinful, none of these people would fall foul of the stirring up of hatred offence for solely stating their belief - even if they did so in a robust manner.\n\n\"Why? Because solely stating any belief, which I accept may be offensive to some, is not breaching the criminal threshold.\n\n\"This bill makes clear that we are listening to the victims of hate crime.\"\n\nIt was described in a heated five-hour debate as \"the most controversial\" piece of legislation ever considered by the Scottish Parliament.\n\nFrom its troubled beginnings, the Hate Crime Bill has been altered significantly. Changes were made during cross-party efforts in what some MSPs described as \"Holyrood at its best\".\n\nYet even with that scrutiny, concerns remain. Offences can now be committed even in private, an abandonment of an earlier \"dwelling defence\" in race hate law.\n\nEven with the Scottish government's insistence that the bar for prosecution is high, there are those who still believe this is an example of interference in private and family life. Why should any government, they ask, decide what can and can't be said in the privacy of one's home?\n\nWhat is the difference, though, if one intends to encourage others into action against a vulnerable section of the community, whether that encouragement is in public or in private? That's the position of the Scottish government.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of sex. Some - including Labour's Johann Lamont - say the bill should have done more to protect women. She referred to the violence and abuse women suffer at the hands of men.\n\nThis debate goes to the heart of how individuals identify themselves and asks how the authorities might permit them to discuss their place in society. MSPs have found themselves trying to strike a delicate balance between freedom of expression and freedom from persecution. Have they succeeded? Opinions vary.\n\nSo, having said all that, what does all this actually mean for you? Well, it depends on who YOU are and - crucially - how you're defined by this new law.\n\nHowever, Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said there was \"inherent ambiguity\" in the language of the legislation.\n\nHe claimed it did not strike the right \"balance\" between free expression and protection from hate.\n\nAnother amendment from MSP Johann Lamont that would have included women as a protected group under the legislation was defeated.\n\nThe government has instead set a working group to look at whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime.\n\nThis group, led by QC Baroness Helena Kennedy, is due to report within a year.\n\nScottish Labour's Neil Bibby agreed with Ms Lamont that the legislation was \"flawed\" because sex was not included as a protected characteristic.\n\nHowever he said we \"ultimately have to recognise this bill will give protection to minorities\".\n\nHe said: \"It makes sense that we should seek to consolidate, modernise and reform Scotland's hate crime laws. We need this bill because hate crime has become more widespread. Society has become more polarised and divided.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur also said he thought it was \"anomalous\" to leave out sex as a protected characteristic.\n\nHe said his concerns had \"not wholly disappeared\" but he had been \"persuaded on balance\" to vote for the bill.\n\nMSP John Finnie from the Greens dismissed suggestions from opponents that family dinners could be \"ruined by a flurry of arrests\" if people made controversial comments.\n\nHe said: \"The bill, like others, is about balance, and I think the balance between the freedom of expression and the right to private life has been struck by this bill, and countless organisations agree.\"",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Labour has accused Boris Johnson of lying to MPs after he wrongly claimed Sir Keir Starmer had voted against a pay rise for NHS workers in England.\n\nThe party is calling on the PM to \"correct the record\" after he said Labour had voted against a 2.1% rise.\n\nThe 2.1% proposal - which has since been scrapped in favour of 1% - was approved without a vote in 2020.\n\nDowning Street said the mistake had been clarified and there was no need for the PM to apologise.\n\nDuring exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"Two years ago he made a promise to the NHS - here in black and white, his document - it commits to a minimum pay rise of 2.1%. It's being budgeted for and now it's being taken away.\n\n\"He shakes his head - his MPs voted for it. So why, after everything the NHS has done for us, is he now breaking promise after promise?\"\n\nMr Johnson replied: \"He voted against the document in question to crown the absurdity of his point.\"\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to \"get the prime minister to return to the House and correct the record\".\n\nMr Ashworth said: \"The prime minister has twice, from that dispatch box, said that the Labour opposition voted against the NHS Funding Bill and the 2.1% increase for NHS staff. This is not the case.\"\n\nSir Lindsay said Mr Ashworth's intervention was not something he would rule on but added \"it is certainly a point of clarification - that part has been achieved\".\n\nWriting on Twitter later, Mr Ashworth said that Mr Johnson had \"lied at PMQs\" and repeated Labour's demand for a vote in Parliament on the 1% offer.\n\nHe has written to the PM to ask him to \"correct the record\", telling him: \"At all times in the debate, Labour attempted to secure a greater financial settlement for the NHS in order to improve patient care.\"\n\nLabour says the proposed 1% rise amounts to a pay cut, when inflation has been taken into account.\n\nMr Johnson says it is all the country can afford at the present time, and NHS workers are set for a rise amid a public sector pay freeze, to reflect the \"massive debt\" owed to them by the nation.\n\nThe PM says he will make a final decision on pay when an independent review reports back in May.\n\nBoris Johnson told MPs Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS, after the Labour leader referred to it.\n\nThat is not correct - there were no votes on the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament.\n\nSir Keir had referred to the plan, saying that it committed the government to a 2.1% pay rise for the NHS.\n\nThe government has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens told a committee of MPs that the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise.\n\nBut he also said \"things have changed\" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body.\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton was asked more than 20 questions about the row at briefing for Westminster journalists.\n\nShe indicated that he would neither apologise nor correct the record.\n\n\"The key thing is that this was dealt with swiftly and the Speaker - who has enormous respect and authority in Parliament - regards it as a point of clarification and it has now been dealt with,\" she told reporters.\n\nAsked if Mr Johnson had a problem with facts, Ms Stratton said: \"No, he doesn't. The Speaker addressed this as a point of clarification and it has been dealt with today.\"\n\nThe ministerial code states that it is of \"paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity\".\n\nMs Stratton said Mr Johnson \"absolutely agrees\" with the ministerial code and \"in this instance the system worked\" because the Speaker had responded to Mr Ashworth.",

            "content": "The \"forcing techniques\" of magic can also be used by businesses and politicians\n\nUnderstanding how magic tricks work could help to protect people from manipulation by politicians and marketing, say researchers.\n\nA study from Goldsmiths, University of London, says the psychology used by magicians to deceive audiences can also be used to influence consumer choices.\n\nMagic tricks use \"powerful tools\" to control behaviour, say the researchers.\n\nThe psychologists looked at how tricks create an \"illusion of choice\", when the audience has no real control.\n\nThe research - Mind control trick: magicians' forcing and free will, by psychologists Alice Pailhes and Gustav Kuhn - examines how magicians control their audiences' decisions - and how this can be applied to other areas.\n\n\"A lot of these magic principles show that you can very easily manipulate and influence decisions that people make - and even though they feel free to have made that decision, the magician has pretty much full control,\" says Dr Kuhn.\n\nGustav Kuhn says magic tricks can rely on people thinking they have more choice than they really have\n\nHe says in the same way that someone might be directed to choose the \"right\" card in a magic trick, so, too, we can be \"nudged\" towards buying products in the supermarket.\n\nThe study, published in Trends in Cognitive Science, identifies different psychological tools used by magicians.\n\nAt its most simple it can be recognising that people tend to behave in similar ways - so the researchers say that if people are asked to pick one of four cards laid in front of them, 60% of right-handed people will pick the one that is third from the left.\n\nThis \"position force\" can be used to push customers towards certain products, depending on where they have been placed.\n\n\"Mental priming\" uses a repeated series of visual and verbal cues to steer an audience in a trick - and researchers found that many people could not explain why they had picked the same \"random\" number or card.\n\nThere is also the so-called \"equivoke\" used by magicians - where the audience believes they are making independent decisions during a trick, while in reality nothing they do has \"any impact on the outcome\".\n\n\"Regardless of the spectator's choice, the sequences result in the same outcome. The equivoke is highly effective in providing an illusory sense of control,\" says the study.\n\nAn example of this would be a card trick in which someone is invited to cut a pack of cards, with a series of stages of cutting and putting cards back on top - the \"vast majority\" fail to realise they have no impact on the target card.\n\nDr Kuhn says the magician's \"illusion of choice\", playing on the need to feel in control, can be applied elsewhere - to consumer decisions, online entertainment or political debates.\n\n\"It really deals with one of the most fundamental concepts in humanity - do we genuinely have free will?\n\n\"We feel we need it, but this experience of free will might actually be an illusion - and it's an illusion that magicians often manipulate,\" says the psychologist.\n\nDr Kuhn, part of the Magic Lab research team, says there is growing interest in understanding how magicians' \"forcing techniques\" can be used to influence behaviour.\n\nHe sees politicians increasingly drawing on the tactic of \"misdirection\", where a magician draws the audience's attention in one direction, with something noisy or spectacular, while the real moves are being made out of sight.\n\n\"Even if you know you're being misdirected, the problem is these principles are just incredibly effective and they still have an impact,\" says Dr Kuhn.\n\nUsing techniques from magic to \"modify behaviour\" can bring positive benefits, says co-author Alice Pailhes.\n\n\"They might provide new ways of encouraging better decisions in health and wellbeing,\" she says, such as steering people towards healthier food.\n\n\"But covert control and modification of people's thoughts raises serious ethical issues, too.\"\n\nAnd she warns of \"unwanted influences, such as political propaganda\".\n\n\"We believe that understanding magicians' forcing techniques is a valuable tool to raise awareness about the ease by which our choices can be manipulated,\" says the psychologist.",

            "content": "The biggest rise for 2021-22 is just under 7%, more than seven times the current rate of inflation\n\nCouncil tax bills are going up by at least twice the rate of inflation across Wales.\n\nThe rises range from 2.65% in Rhondda Cynon Taf to 6.95% in Wrexham, although the north-eastern county still charges less than most authorities in Wales.\n\nThe Welsh Government has increased its funding for councils by more than inflation for the second year running.\n\nIt said a hardship fund ensured council costs of the pandemic would not be an \"added pressure\" on council tax payers.\n\nInflation was 0.9% in the year to January 2021, according to the latest figures available from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nCore funding from the Welsh Government covers between two-thirds and three-quarters of each council's spending.\n\nThe rest comes from council tax, and other income such as fees and direct charges for council-run services.\n\nA spokesperson for the Welsh Local Government Association said: \"All councils will use their local discretion to set their council tax levels, in line with local needs and circumstances.\n\n\"This year more than ever we have seen the importance of our essential local services, and council tax is a vital revenue stream to help fund them.\n\n\"However, local authorities also recognise that many families have been hard hit by the pandemic and councils have strived to keep any increases as low as possible whilst continuing to maintain local services in our communities.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"In 2021-22, local authorities in Wales will receive \u00a34.65bn in general revenue allocations from core funding and non-domestic rates. This is an increase of 3.8% on a like-for-like basis and follows this year's 4.3% increase.\n\n\"Local authorities in Wales have the flexibility to set their budgets and council tax levels according to local needs and priorities. These decisions are an important part of local democracy, and ones for which individual authorities are accountable to their local electorates.\n\n\"We have also provided more than \u00a3206m in our budget to continue the Local Government Hardship Fund, which will ensure the financial impacts of the pandemic on local government will not be an added pressure on council taxpayers.\"\n\nPembrokeshire charges the lowest council tax of any county council in Wales\n\nPembrokeshire will still have the lowest charge for each type of property - \u00a31,190 for Band D.\n\nWhile Rhondda Cynon Taf will once again see the smallest increase, it has the fifth-highest charge of the 22 Welsh councils for each property band.\n\nCharges for the police and - in areas that have them - town and community councils can add about \u00a3300 a year to a household's bill.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Police investigating the disappearance of Sarah Everard are searching a home and woodland in Kent following the arrest of a serving Met officer.\n\nThe 33-year-old was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March.\n\nThe policeman and a woman were arrested at a house in Kent on Tuesday. Searches are being carried out at a building in Deal as well as on land near Ashford.\n\nThe Met said it was \"shocking and deeply disturbing\" that the arrested man was a serving officer.\n\nMs Everard's family have been kept updated, the force added.\n\nA tent has been erected outside a house in Deal and a car was earlier seen being taken away from the property.\n\nOfficers have also been carrying out searches on land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford.\n\nRetired farmer Derek Batt, 72, of nearby Fridd Farm, said officers visited his property late on Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \"They said they were investigating a missing person. I said 'is it Sarah that I have seen on TV?' and she (the officer) said 'yes'.\"\n\nMr Batt said he had not seen any suspicious activity in the area.\n\nIn a statement, the Met Police said the man and the woman had both been taken into custody at a London police station.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the arrests were \"a serious and significant development\".\n\n\"We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing.\"\n\nDuring a later statement, he added the officer \"was not on duty at the time\" when Ms Everard went missing and would only confirm he had been arrested \"in connection\" with her disappearance.\n\nHe also would not say if the officer was known to the 33-year-old.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if police believed she was still alive, Mr Ephgrave replied: \"We are searching as hard as we can to find Sarah, so we really hope that is the case.\n\n\"As a father myself of four young women I can only imagine the anguish that Sarah's family are feeling at this very very difficult time.\"\n\nThe arrested woman has been held on suspicion of assisting an offender, the force has confirmed.\n\nOn Tuesday, officers searching for Ms Everard had put up a cordon outside a block of flats in Clapham near to where she was last seen on Poynders Road and sniffer dogs have been used to search the nearby Oaklands Estate and gardens.\n\nMs Everard's family said it was out of character for her to disappear\n\nOfficers were also seen searching drains along the street where Ms Everard was last seen.\n\nThe Met said officers had visited 750 homes in the area as part of the investigation and the force had received more than 120 phone calls from the public.\n\nFriends and relatives have issued appeals on social media to help find the marketing manager, who vanished on her walk home to Brixton after leaving a friend's flat in Leathwaite Road in Battersea at about 21:00 GMT.\n\nHer family has said it is out of character for her to disappear.\n\nMs Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat.\n\nShe is believed to have walked through Clapham Common towards her home - a journey that should have taken her about 50 minutes.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were \"with Sarah and her friends and family\".\n\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The race issues raised by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their interview with Oprah Winfrey are \"concerning\" and \"taken very seriously\", Buckingham Palace has said.\n\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but the matters would be addressed privately.\n\nMeghan told Oprah that Harry had been asked by an unnamed family member \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\n\nThe Palace said the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\n\nThe response from Buckingham Palace came after crisis meetings involving senior royals.\n\nThe Palace had been under growing pressure to respond to the interview in which Meghan - the first mixed-race member of the modern Royal Family - said that before their son Archie was born, questions had been asked about his skin colour.\n\nPrince Harry later clarified to Oprah that the comments were not made by either the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\n\nIn other developments, Piers Morgan has stood by the comments that led to his departure from ITV's Good Morning Britain show - including that he did not \"believe a word\" of what Meghan said in the interview.\n\nIt is reported a formal complaint by the duchess has been lodged with ITV but neither representatives for the Sussexes nor ITV have confirmed this.\n\nChris Ship, the royal editor of ITV News, said in a tweet that it was believed Meghan had raised concerns about how Morgan's words \"affect the issue of mental health and what it might do to others contemplating suicide\".\n\nThe statement from the Palace, which came a day and a half after the interview was first broadcast in the US, said: \"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.\n\n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\n\n\"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nIt is understood the royals wanted to carefully consider their response and to give the British public an opportunity to watch the interview first, when it was broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nThey are said to consider this a family matter and to believe they should be given the opportunity to discuss the issues privately.\n\nDowning Street has confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson has watched the interview, but his official spokesman declined to comment on the Palace's statement.\n\nAlthough likely, it was never absolutely certain that the Queen would issue a statement following the interview given by her grandson and his wife.\n\nThe risk was that any response would add to the \"royals in crisis\" narrative which is playing out across front pages and TV screens across the globe.\n\nBut having had time to discuss the claims made by Harry and Meghan, four short sentences convey the message from the Palace that this is a private family matter and the specific allegations will not be publicly addressed.\n\nThe tone is conciliatory, with reference to the Sussexes as much loved family members. There is a gentle challenge in the line \"whilst some recollections may vary\", but also an assurance that concerns will be taken seriously.\n\nAnd we can be sure that - at least as far as the UK-based royals are concerned - any bridge-building will be done in private.\n\nMeanwhile, the board of the Society of Editors has said it will \"work towards being part of the solution\" after coming under fire for its initial reaction to Meghan and Harry's interview.\n\nIt previously said it was \"not acceptable\" for the couple to make claims of racism in the press \"without providing any supporting evidence\".\n\nBut in a new statement the organisation said its earlier comments did not address that \"there is a lot of work to be done in the media to improve diversity and inclusion\".\n\n\"We will reflect on the reaction our statement prompted and work towards being part of the solution,\" it added.\n\nIt comes as MPs could push for a House of Commons debate to discuss possible actions following the media's \"hounding\" of Meghan.\n\nLabour's Holly Lynch, who co-ordinated a letter from female MPs in support of Meghan in 2019, has questioned the way the press is regulated.\n\n\"How long do you continue to let that fail before you have to recognise it has failed and say 'what next?'\" she said.\n\nDuring a visit in London earlier, Prince Charles did not respond when he was asked if he had seen the interview, in which the Sussexes addressed deeply personal topics of racism, mental health, the media and other members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe UK broadcast on Monday night was watched by an average of 11.1 million people.\n\nIn it, the duchess said there had been times when she \"didn't want to be alive any more\" because she found royal life so difficult. She said she asked for help from the Palace but received none.\n\nOne of Meghan's close friends said she had been \"worried, terrified, sad\" to see the duchess's mental health problems.\n\nActress Janina Gavankar also told ITV's This Morning: \"The family and the staff were well aware of the extent of it, and though their 'recollections may vary', ours don't, because we lived through it with them.\"\n\nGavankar, who watched the TV show air with both Meghan and Harry, added the couple were \"feeling free\" since the broadcast.\n\nMeghan told Oprah that conversations about how dark Archie's skin might be when he was born took place \"in tandem\" with discussions about why he would not be given a royal title and police protection.\n\nUnder rules in place since 1917, the couple's children would not automatically become princes or princesses - unless the Queen was to intervene.",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "So, now we know what a laser sounds like on another world.\n\nThe US space agency's Perseverance rover has deployed its SuperCam instrument on Mars for the first time.\n\nThis high-intensity light probe can identify rocks at a distance. It's a technique that was also employed by Nasa's previous rover, Curiosity.\n\nBut Perseverance has some enhancements, including a microphone that allows us to actually hear the laser at work.\n\nThis isn't just some nice-to-have feature, a gimmick for PR purposes, but provides extra information that is useful to scientists.\n\nThe sound of the laser hitting rocks reveals knowledge such as the hardness of the targets being investigated.\n\n\"If we tap on a surface that is hard, we will not hear the same sound as when we fire on a surface that is soft,\" explained Naomi Murdoch, from the National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space, in Toulouse.\n\n\"Take for example chalk and marble. These two materials have an identical chemical composition (calcium carbonate), but very different physical properties.\"\n\nThe SuperCam laser is mounted on the rover mast head (large round window)\n\nIn a media briefing on Wednesday, Dr Murdoch played three different sounds recorded by the SuperCam microphone. One was of the general sound of Mars, the second was of some wind gusts, and the third was the staccato pops from the laser in action.\n\nPerseverance landed in Mars' Jezero Crater on 18 February to search for evidence of past life. The deep bowl is regarded as an excellent location for such a quest because it almost certainly held a lake billions of years ago; and where there's been water, perhaps there's been life, too.\n\nThe SuperCam instrument was developed in a partnership between French and American research teams.\n\nIts first rock target selected for study was dubbed \"M\u00e1az\", which means Mars in the Navajo language spoken by Native Americans in the southwestern United States.\n\nM\u00e1az was found, to no-one's real surprise, to be basaltic in nature. Basalt is very common on Mars.\n\nSuperCam's micro-imager also took this picture of the rock dubbed \u201cM\u00e1az\u201d\n\nIt's a rock that contains a lot of magnesium and iron, and is the sort of thing that forms from rapidly cooled lava.\n\n\"We don't know yet if this rock itself is igneous, ie volcanic, or perhaps if it is a sedimentary rock made up of igneous grains that were washed down river into Jezero lake and cemented together,\" said SuperCam principal investigator Roger Wiens, from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\n\n\"We'll have to use more of our techniques and study the surrounding area to understand those details some more.\"\n\nPerseverance has spent most of its first three weeks on Mars going through post-landing checks. It has, though, started driving in a north-easterly direction.\n\nAn immediate goal is a helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth.\n\nThe vehicle is looking for a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device, called Ingenuity, can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly.\n\nM\u00e1az is the long rock feature at top-right in this Perseverance image",

By joining forces in some way now hopefully... we might be able to do something wonderful,\" she added.\n\nSir Kenneth Branagh and Natalie Dormer have also lent their support to the campaign\n\nWinslet also believes professional theatre companies \"would hire Reading Gaol as a creative space to bring their productions\".\n\n\"Shows will often start at those out-of-town venues and then maybe transfer into London,\" she explained.\n\n\"How exciting for something like that to begin in Reading, something that increases local employment and encourages people to join... it's a really fantastic opportunity.\"\n\nThe actress also pledged: \"I'll be there performing on the first night, I sign up to that now.\"\n\nMr Davies, who said he was thrilled by Winslet's support, added: \"It's an opportunity to represent Wilde and correct everything that was done to him and the opportunity to totally transform a significant part of England culturally to really make a massive difference.\"\n\nOther well-known actors have also thrown their weight behind the campaign, including Dame Judi Dench, Sir Kenneth Branagh, Natalie Dormer and Stephen Fry, who portrayed Irish playwright Wilde in the 1997 film Wilde.\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

            "content": "The Duke of Cambridge has said the royals are \"very much not a racist family\" in his first comments after accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a TV interview.\n\nPrince William also said he had not yet spoken to his brother but would do so.\n\nMeghan and Prince Harry said a royal had expressed concern over \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\n\nBuckingham Palace previously said the claim was \"concerning\" but it would be addressed privately.\n\nIn a statement, the Palace said \"recollections may vary\" but that the Sussexes would \"always be much loved family members\".\n\nDuring a visit to a school in Stratford, east London, on Thursday, Prince William was asked by a reporter: \"Is the Royal Family a racist family, sir?\"\n\nThe duke replied: \"We're very much not a racist family.\"\n\nAsked whether he had spoken to Prince Harry since the Oprah interview, Prince William said: \"No, I haven't spoken to him yet but I will do.\"\n\nPrince William's visit is not the first appearance by a senior royal since the interview aired - the Prince of Wales carried out an engagement earlier this week.\n\nDespite Prince William's team making clear to reporters he wouldn't be answering questions, he must have known they might come. One wonders if he had planned to engage or whether the answers were impromptu.\n\nWilliam will be well aware that anything he utters will be headline news.\n\nThe first question alluded to the rift between the two brothers. In the Oprah interview, Prince Harry said their relationship is \"space\" at the moment but that \"time heals all things hopefully\".\n\nWe don't know when they last spoke but we do now know that William does intend to speak to him.\n\nAs for the second and more direct question - \"Is the royal family a racist family, sir?\" - William could have ignored it. But, despite the Queen's statement saying the race issue would be dealt with privately, the prince clearly felt he had to push back on what has become a very public and damaging allegation.\n\nRemaining silent, he felt, was not the best option.\n\nIn the TV interview, Meghan told Oprah there were \"concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie's] skin might be when he was born\".\n\nBoth Prince Harry and Meghan refused to say who made the comment - but Harry later clarified to Oprah that it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nDuring the interview Harry also said it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the \"colonial undertones\" of news headlines and articles.\n\nAnd asked by Oprah if the couple left the UK because of racism from the tabloid media, Harry replied: \"It was a large part of it.\"\n\nIn the interview, Harry also spoke about his relationship with his family - especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother Prince William.\n\nAt one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles \"stopped taking my calls\".\n\nAnd of William, Harry said: \"The relationship is 'space' at the moment. And time heals all things, hopefully.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace issued a response to the interview earlier this week following crisis meetings involving senior royals.\n\nFigures from US TV network CBS suggest that nearly 50 million people around the world have watched Oprah's interview with the couple.\n\nThe fallout from the interview has also seen broadcaster Piers Morgan leave his role as host of Good Morning Britain, after his comments about Meghan attracted 41,000 complaints.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Society of Editors - an industry body for the UK press - resigned after a row over its reaction to Harry's comments about the tabloid media.",

            "content": "Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers.\n\nCyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack.\n\nIt comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems.\n\nBut some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos.\n\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly.\n\nThe hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium.\n\nMicrosoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies.\n\nThe attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world.\n\nMicrosoft released software updates for the so called \"zero-day\" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves.\n\nHowever, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected.\n\nAccording to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries.\n\nCyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves.\n\n\"As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,\" Jake Moore at Eset said.\n\n\"The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers.\"\n\nA webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network.\n\nOnce installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks.\n\nGlobally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK.\n\nCyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems.\n\nCyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour.\n\nThe companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail.\n\nSean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: \"It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems.\n\n\"It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind.\n\n\"There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.\"",

            "description": "The British-Iranian woman faces a new court hearing this weekend, following a five-year sentence.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016, needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a medical report sent by a charity to the UK government.\n\nThe charity worker faces a new court hearing in Tehran on Sunday, a week after her ankle tag was removed.\n\nThe report says she is suffering from major depression and PTSD.\n\nDespite her sentence coming to an end, she is still waiting to return to the UK to be reunited with her family.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for membership of organisations working against the Iranian government, allegations which she has always denied.\n\nPrior to the recent removal of the ankle tag, the dual national had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called for her permanent release so she can return home to her husband and young daughter in the UK.\n\nThe report - commissioned by the human rights charity Redress - says she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence.\n\nThe Redress report was based on a medical evaluation carried out virtually by doctors while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was under house arrest towards the end of last year. It was completed last month and sent to the government on Thursday.\n\nNeither Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her husband Richard has felt able to read the report in full, but both feel that it is important to have her ordeal documented, giving the charity the go-ahead to share the details with the BBC.\n\nIn the medical evaluation, she also told doctors she suffered hair loss, had to listen to her female guard talking loudly to her child while separated from her own daughter, and developed OCD around washing.\n\nAccording to the report, her post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder are due to \"extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran\" and the uncertainty about her fate - and warns things could worsen without her being treated and reunited with her family in the UK.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\n\nWhilst in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence, she was interrogated - often blindfolded - for eight to nine hours a day, she told the doctors who examined her online.\n\n\"The interrogations were traumatising,\" she is quoted as saying in the report. \"They were threatening to send my child away, told me my husband was a spy, that he had already left me, that he was lying to me, that he worked for the British intelligence service.\n\n\"They said he was unfaithful, they said he was not an accountant and that he had always been lying to me. They told me I had been fired from my job.\"\n\nShe says she was in a tiny cell - a 1.5 to 2-metre square - during solitary confinement. It had no window, made her feel claustrophobic and she could not tell the difference between night and day.\n\n\"The light was left on all the time there was only a dirty mat on the floor with a thin blanket to sleep on,\" she says. \"There were times I could not breathe.\"\n\nShe was only allowed one sanitary pad a month during this time.\n\nMr Ratcliffe says of his wife's documented experiences: \"This is mental torture. It's a really horrific experience. And it's cumulative. And it builds up. And of course, most of it has been hidden away.\n\n\"She didn't talk about it a lot when she came out. I don't talk to the media about some of the stuff. But I think it's important to put it on the record. It's important that our government takes responsibility for protecting people.\"\n\nThe two doctors carrying out the evaluation were told that, while in prison, she developed OCD centred around cleaning rituals.\n\nMr Ratcliffe spoke to the BBC of his wife's \"need to try and control what you can, leading to a sort of obsessive control about certain things and having certain routines to cope with the other things you can't control - all the things that are completely out of your hands\".\n\nHe adds: \"And of course, Nazanin's entire life is out of her hands.\"\n\nHer interrogators tried to pressure her into co-operating with them, in exchange for clemency, she told the doctors.\n\n\"I said that I could not do, that I said I needed so much psychological help that I was not even sure I could work for myself, let alone work for my captors,\" she reported.\n\nShe told the doctors that one of her female guards would talk loudly to her child just outside her cell, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was separated from her own daughter.\n\n\"It was unbearable,\" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the medics. \"I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me.\"\n\nRichard Ratcliffe has not seen his wife in person since 2016\n\nIn July 2018, she spent a week in a psychiatric hospital, accompanied by prison guards and chained to the bed by both her feet and hands.\n\nHer incarceration took a significant physical toll on her health as well, the report finds. At one point, in jail, her hair was falling out and she was too weak to climb up to the top bunk in the women's ward where she was held for most of her imprisonment.\n\nThe report details the continuing guilt and anguish she feels and says she has tried to put a brave face on her ordeal and hide her symptoms from her parents, with whom she now lives.\n\n\"She knows that her suffering traumatises her parents and that her post-traumatic symptoms, like irritation and anger, harm her parents' psychological health,\" the report says.\n\n\"She also knows that her absence might create serious traumatic problems in her daughter who is being forced to grow up without the presence of her caring mother. Her imprisonment is a huge burden on her marital relationship. As her husband is struggling to gain her freedom, these efforts also keep him in a constant state of stress and suffering instead of continuing the ordinary life of a parent and a husband.\"\n\nDr Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, is one of the doctors who conducted the evaluation for the Independent Forensic Expert Group.\n\nShe described Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a \"remarkably resilient woman\" who was \"trying to keep hope, trying to be strong\" during her evaluation.\n\nBut she said: \"Her current situation continues the psychological torture. Although she has finished five years of being imprisoned, she faces ongoing threat and uncertainty.\"\n\nShe may have spared her parents the details, but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reported to the doctors that she felt constant sadness, had suicidal thoughts, and suffered other manifestations of extreme anxiety - including trembling, tingling, and hot and cold sweats.\n\nConcern that lumps in her breasts could be cancerous have contributed to her anxiety. And she also has continuing neurological and muscular-skeleton problems, as a result of prolonged confinement, according to the report.\n\nThe doctors say it is \"possible that the positions in which she was handcuffed for extended periods led to nerve and joint injury\" in her right hand.\n\nAnd even once she is safely home in the UK with her family, the report makes clear that there will be a long road to recovery.\n\nShe will need medication as well as psychotherapy and treatment for her physical symptoms.\n\n\"Nazanin's healing can be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification,\" it concludes. \"In order to recover, she needs to be in a safe and non-threatening environment.\"\n\nBut it's not clear whether Sunday's court hearing will be used to block her return to the UK.\n\n\"The threat of a second trial remains very real,\" says Rupert Skilbeck of Redress, which acts as her and her husband's legal representative.\n\n\"This report is evidence of the severe suffering that Nazanin has experienced in Iran due to the mistreatment suffered and the cruelty of a legal process that has never followed the rule of law, making it impossible for Nazanin to know when she will be reunited with her family.\"\n\nHer treatment, Redress says, clearly amounts to torture.\n\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"Iran continues to put Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe through a cruel and intolerable ordeal. Nazanin must be allowed to return permanently to her family in the UK and we will continue to do all we can to achieve this.\"",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Traditionally the Palace protects the family by drawing a curtain between the public, formal stuff and the personal stuff; its refusal to comment on the personal is a strategic interpretation of the family's maxim - \"never explain, never complain\".\n\nThe public/personal divide has always been an artifice. Royals get married in front of tens of millions of people, have state funerals, release photos on birthdays and anniversaries, exchange insights into their lives in return for easy-going and generous coverage.\n\nBut the divide, however often disregarded, remains the guiding principle of the family's formal relationship with the outside world. Now the contradictions that spring from the mix of personal and public are playing out.\n\nSome key allegations are about the personal behaviour and comments of members of the Royal Family and how, through collective neglect and perhaps some malicious intent, they left Harry and Meghan no choice but to leave.\n\nOther statements painted a terrible portrait of unfeeling staff and courtiers. The entire institution was portrayed as if nothing had been learnt from the days of Diana - Prince Harry and Prince William's late mother.\n\nThe duchess is a formidable communicator and has proved herself a very bad woman to pick a fight with. A newly-liberated Harry spoke with almost-eloquence.\n\nMeghan dealt some of the heaviest blows. What is the Palace to say about the accusation that an unnamed member of the family made a comment - more than one by the sounds of things - about the skin colour of the couple's child-to-be? The mind boggles.\n\nBut alongside the personal pain and anger rippling through the duchess's testimony, there came from Harry condemnation of the institution - the suggestion that it was incapable of change, incapable of love, incapable of understanding.\n\nThe contradictions of the Palace, and of the monarchy, are exactly that which makes it so special, so strange, so interesting and so difficult to work within - the merging of personal and public roles, the accretion of tradition, the mix of public accountability, ceaseless media interest and the need to remain relevant.\n\nHarry's suggestion that his family too - his father Prince Charles, his brother Prince William - are \"trapped\" in their world, and that he felt \"compassion\" for them, was a velvet-covered knife into the heart of the modern monarchy.\n\nRoyal life is conducted from within a gilded cage; the players are not meant to rattle the bars from the outside.\n\nThese are the contradictions Harry walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. He was uncomfortable with them before he was married. And when he saw his wife suffering as a result of his being \"trapped\" in royal life, he found a way out with her.\n\nThere are also the contradictions that lie behind many of the decisions that they both spoke out about and are clearly very unhappy about.\n\nIt is public money that pays for security. It is tradition that dictates who gets what title. There is no HR department for working royals because it is a family affair. What you do in front of the cameras matters because it reflects on the institution as a whole.\n\nThis meshing of personal and public is unique. It is what being a modern royal is all about. And inside it is often a hugely uncomfortable place to be. Harry knew that. Presumably he warned Meghan. But that warning wasn't enough.\n\nHarry and Meghan's experience suggests that the contradictions are too great. Maybe their interview will act as a catalyst for change. But the Crown has been around for a very long time, and change does not come easily to a body in which the past plays such an outsize role.",

She has always denied the charges against her.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister spoke to Iranian president Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday afternoon, and raised the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran \"and demanded their immediate release\".\n\nThe spokesman added: \"He said that while the removal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's ankle monitor was welcome, her continued confinement remains completely unacceptable and she must be allowed to return to her family in the UK.\"\n\nMr Johnson, while stressing that the UK remains committed to making the Iran nuclear deal a success, also demanded that Iran cease all of its nuclear activity which breaches the deal, the spokesman said.\n\n\"He stressed the importance of Iran seizing the opportunity presented by the United States' willingness to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance,\" he said.\n\n\"The prime minister underlined the need for Iran to cease wider destabilising activity and be a positive force in the Gulf region.\"\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband Richard Ratcliffe, who has not seen his wife in person since she left the UK in 2016\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, had been out of prison since last spring due to the coronavirus pandemic but had been confined to her parents' house.\n\nShe was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents in Iran with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six years old.\n\nThe dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denies.\n\nSpeaking after her ankle tag was removed, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said it was \"a mixed day for us\" and \"Nazanin is genuinely happy\" to be free of her electronic bracelet.\n\n\"I'm a bit more guarded - it feels to me like they have made one blockage just as they have removed another, and we very clearly remain in the middle of this government game of chess,\" he said.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison in August 2018\n\nAs of Sunday, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had not had her British passport returned to her, according to Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in London where her family live.\n\nMs Siddiq told the BBC: \"She does have to go back to court and we don't know what awaits her there.\n\n\"Nazanin is quite worried because there was talk of another case being put against her which may of course mean another sentence, and we don't know how long for.\"\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence has included eight months of solitary confinement, blindfolded interrogations and hunger strikes to press for medical treatment.\n\nPrior to her arrest, she lived in London with her husband and child.\n\nIn November, she was taken to court on fresh charges of spreading propaganda against the Iranian regime.\n\nHer family and the UK government have always maintained her innocence and she has been given diplomatic protection by the Foreign Office - meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran.\n\nMr Ratcliffe believes his wife and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "M&S will start selling clothes from 11 rival brands on its website this spring in a bid to boost its online sales.\n\nMarks said the move to sell items from Hobbs, Joules, Phase Eight and White Stuff from March was part of its ongoing \"transformation programme\".\n\nAn M&S spokesman said the move came as part of plans to \"turbocharge online growth\".\n\nLast year, M&S posted its first loss in its 94 years as a publicly-listed company as Covid hit shop sales.\n\nOnline clothing and homeware sales were up 34% according to its latest interim results, as losses across the business reached \u00a387.6m in the six months to 26 September.\n\nThe High Street stalwart is in the middle of a wide-reaching transformation programme, which last year saw 7,000 job cuts across stores and management.\n\nOther brands set to be marketed on the M&S website online from spring include the menswear brand Jack & Jones and lingerie firm Sloggi.\n\nThey will appear alongside other M&S items, while its own 'Classics' and 'Limited' ranges are being cut.\n\nThe firm had already been experimenting with selling other brands on its website, such as womenswear retailer Nobody's Child, which was the first to launch last autumn.\n\nExecutives hope new labels will draw in customers that might not typically shop with M&S, as well as offering existing customers something new.\n\nNeil Harrison, director of brands at M&S, said: \"The exciting mix will offer our 22 million customers products we already know they love and introduce them to some new brands.\"\n\nThis is a big shake-up for M&S fashion.\n\nNew tie-ups have been coming thick and fast these last few months giving customers more choice. Up until last year, M&S only stocked clothing from its own collections.\n\nNow it's branching out with other brands to complement its own offer - and it's a sensible move. So too is pruning its own, sometimes confusing, fashion ranges.\n\nThis pandemic has wreaked havoc for retail but it's also creating opportunities.\n\nTake Next, a business which already had lots of third-party brands on its website pre-pandemic. On Wednesday, it took a stake in Reiss, which will allow the chain to use Next's online infrastructure.\n\nBoohoo and Asos have also been snapping up High Street brands, like Karen Millen and Topshop, as they try to attract a broader range of shoppers.\n\nThere's been quite a battle for brands this last year and M&S clearly thinks that it's now taking a big, strategic, step in the right direction.\n\nAlthough M&S said that there could also be \"future opportunities\" in UK stores for some brands, its key focus in recent months has been on overhauling its website amid rising competition from fast fashion firms such as Asos and Boohoo.\n\nThe retailer recently announced that it will launch 46 new websites in overseas markets from Iceland to Uzbekistan in order to grow its online business.\n\nIn January it also confirmed that it had bought the Jaeger fashion brand, but not its scores of shops and concessions.\n\nSteve Rowe, chief executive of M&S, has previously said his goal is to deliver long-term transformation and build a brand that is more digital \"in a world that will never be the same again\".",

With slow supply, they said home sales can be quick.\n\nPhiddy Robertson of the Galbraith Group in Inverness, said: \"The market is starved of good quality property.\n\n\"Buyers are paying significant premiums to secure attractive coastal property and we are seeing more interest than ever from southern buyers looking for second homes.\"\n\nIn Edinburgh and Glasgow, surveyors found the market more patchy, noting that more flats are coming on the market as private landlords sell.\n\nIn the housing rental market, Scotland had the biggest drop in property availability of any part of the UK.\n\nJohn Brown, a rental agent in Edinburgh, commented: \"The market is fragmented, with fewer enquiries and longer void periods between tenancies.\n\n\"It's clear landlords are looking to reduce portfolios. More legislation, and Energy Performance Certificate standards being enforced, add to costs.\n\n\"Students are registering for next year but trying to be uncommitted - that's the Covid effect\".\n\nIn Dumfries at the Savills agency, Carolyn Davies said renters are looking for demand for rural properties \"but broadband speeds now need to be established prior to letting\".",

They added that blood cancer patients should still definitely have the vaccine.\n\nProf Stephen Evans, professor of pharmaco-epidemiology, from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: \"These data will undoubtedly need to be examined by JCVI, but the evidence that harm has been caused to patients with cancer by delaying a second dose has not yet been demonstrated conclusively.\n\n\"Full follow-up of those who get vaccinated with a delayed second dose will be very important.\"\n\nThe study will continue to follow cancer patients after their vaccinations for up to six months.",

or R-number - for the community in Northern Ireland is \"consistently below one\", said the first minister.\n\nShe said she hoped that the drop in figures meant that the executive would be able to make more announcements next week about easing other restrictions.\n\nMs O'Neill said there would be \"no major shifts\" before Easter but that the executive wanted to allow people time to plan for the coming weeks and months.\n\nMrs Foster also said she recognised that people were facing into a second year with many being unable to spend Mother's Day with their loved ones.\n\nArlene Foster says people should celebrate Mother's Day within their own household\n\n\"Many of us will be relying on cards and phone calls to carry out our love and appreciation,\" she said.\n\nShe also urged anyone wanting to celebrate Mother's Day or St Patrick's Day to do so with their own household.\n\nMs O'Neill said Northern Ireland was \"on the cusp of brighter days\" but warned that going to parties or gathering in groups posed a \"serious risk to a fragile situation\".\n\nMeanwhile, Stormont ministers have also agreed additional funding to support businesses and jobs during the pandemic.\n\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy had proposed extending rates relief for another 12 months for almost 30,000 businesses, in a package worth \u00a3230m.\n\nHis plan means that for the second year running businesses in the following sectors will not pay any rates:\n\nThe executive also announced a Covid-19 support scheme for travel agents experiencing difficulties as a result of the pandemic, worth \u00a31.175m.\n\nIt includes a flat payment of \u00a310,000 to travel agency businesses operating from commercial premises or a \u00a33,500 payment to self-employed travel agents working from home.\n\nThe scheme will open next Friday for a limited time until 26 March.",

            "content": "A court in Germany has declared a 96-year-old former Nazi camp guard unfit to stand trial but ruled that he should pay his own legal fees.\n\nThe man, named as Harry S, was accused of complicity in the murder of several hundred people at Stutthof Camp.\n\nThe court in Wuppertal said there was a \"high degree of probability\" he was guilty of the crimes.\n\nHis is one of three recent cases related to the Stutthof camp, which was located in then Nazi-occupied Poland.\n\nBruno Dey, 93, was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence last July after being found guilty of complicity in the murder of more than 5,000 prisoners.\n\nIn February, 95-year-old Irmgard F - who was a secretary at Stutthof - became one of the few women to be charged with aiding and abetting Nazi-era mass murder.\n\nHarry S was a guard at Stutthof between June 1944 and May 1945.\n\nHe is alleged to have overseen the transportation of nearly 600 prisoners to the gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in September 1944.\n\nHe was charged with aiding and abetting in their murder in 2017.\n\nStutthof also had gas chambers and was notorious for the atrocious conditions in which some 100,000 inmates were kept. Many died of disease and starvation, while others were gassed, shot or given lethal injections.\n\nThe victims included many Jews as well as non-Jewish Poles and captured Soviet soldiers.\n\nThe west German court said in a statement on Wednesday that \"due to his physical condition,\" Harry S \"was no longer able to reasonably represent his interest in and outside of the trial\".\n\nBut it went on to say that, as a guard at the camp, he would have overseen the transports and \"recognised the scope and dimension of the mass murder committed\" there.\n\nAs there was a \"a high degree of probability\" of his guilt, Harry S should pay his own expenses, the court ruled. It is not known how much the costs are, or whether the defendant will appeal.\n\nStutthof was officially designated a concentration camp in 1942. It was the first such camp built outside German borders in the war and the last to be liberated, by the Soviet army on 9 May 1945.\n\nMore than 65,000 people are thought to have died in the camp. Guards began using gas chambers there in June 1944.\n\nGermany has been pursuing former Nazi camp workers since a landmark ruling in 2011 that convicted a former guard, John Demjanjuk, as an accessory to mass murder. He died pending an appeal, but the verdict set a legal precedent.\n\nPreviously, courts had required evidence of former SS guards' direct involvement in atrocities.",

All the workers agreed.\n\nThe firm denied the claim staff might lose their jobs, but said all staff had got their money back plus 20% extra.\n\nThe GMB union said the return of the cash was a \"massive win\" for workers.\n\nIn a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a \"short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support\".\n\nAt the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their \"suitability for the role will have to be reviewed\".\n\nStaff agreed to the request. Tomahawk says that money has now been returned with the 20% addition.\n\nA spokeswoman for Tomahawk said: \"As part of the voluntary agreement signed by all of our staff, we promised that any monies loaned would be returned as soon as we were financially able.\n\n\"Following the budget announcement last week, we are delighted to have been able to swiftly honour that promise this week.\n\n\"All staff have now received the loaned amount, along with an additional 20%, as a thank you for supporting the business at this critical time.\"\n\nGMB regional secretary Neil Derrick said: \"This was always an outrageous exploitation of both the furlough scheme and low paid, young workers.\n\n\"The cash should never have been taken in the first place as no employee can afford a further reduction in their take home pay - especially when it's to cover their employer's own obligations.\n\n\"Tomahawk's bullying behaviour was rightly condemned across the board.

            "section": "Newsbeat",
            "content": "James Newman has released Embers as the song he's taking to represent the UK in this year's Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nHe describes the brassy, dance track as a \"banger\", and says he wanted to create something \"full of positivity\".\n\nAfter the cancellation of Eurovision in 2020, singer-songwriter James has been given a second chance to take part.\n\nIt's due to take place 18-22 May in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, with most countries expected to release their entries by this weekend (13 -14 March).\n\nJames says he wanted to write something \"fun and upbeat\" to mark his return to the competition.\n\n\"Embers is about those sparks that don't die out,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"When we were writing this, it felt like I wanted to show everyone that we were coming back together.\n\n\"It's about having that connection and something reigniting. It's about us emerging from this rubbish time we've been having. It fits with the idea that Eurovision is coming back.\"\n\nHe says he was proud of 2020's entry My Last Breath - a ballad - but it was written in a pre-pandemic climate, so he wanted to write something more positive.\n\n\"Eurovision is a celebration of music and Embers fits in that vibe. Hopefully people like it.\"\n\nThe video's out and James is already in rehearsal mode, working with dancers and choreographers to create the performance which he'll take to the Rotterdam stage.\n\n\"It's weird and cool,\" said my 10-year-old, walking into the room as I played to Embers for the first time. \"I like it\".\n\nHe's got a point. Like Newman's previous Eurovision entry, Embers is a likeable, catchy song that does a good job of dragging the UK away from the dreary nonsense we've been sending to Europe over the last decade.\n\nBut is it going to win? Probably not.\n\nThere are more adventurous and quirky songs already in the running. And Iceland's Daoi Freyr, who scored a genuine international hit with Think About Things last year, is already a favourite for the title - despite the fact his song won't be unveiled until 13 March.\n\nThat said, Newman's lyrics, about rising from the flames, will strike a chord as Europe emerges from lockdown; while the music is assiduously based on recent dance hits by Joel Corry and Jax Jones - all chunky house pianos and cheesy synth riffs.\n\nBut that's also it's downfall: Embers sounds like the sort of record made by someone who's studied prevailing trends, rather than making new discoveries of their own.\n\nAs pop-punk whirlwind Yungblud recently told Music Week Magazine: \"If you're looking at what's current now, you're late.\" Maybe we should send him next year, instead?\n\nThe song's already getting a lot of love on social.\n\nNow that it\u2019s officially out. OUR BEST EUROVISION SONG IN YEARS! First time since 2017 that I can wholeheartedly support our song and the first time since 2014 that I\u2019ve been this excited for us to get a good result \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Go on James!!!!!! \u2014 Paul Ferguson (@pokemon_paul) March 11, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

View original tweet on Twitter\n\nThe aim is to have all 40 acts performing on stage in the Netherlands and organisers have various scenarios in place to ensure Eurovision happens, whatever's happening with the global pandemic.\n\nThey've published guidance on the measures they expect to be introduced, including social distancing, recommended quarantine times and limiting the audience in Rotterdam's Ahoy! arena.\n\nLast week, Eurovision's executive supervisor Martin Osterdahl told the BBC it was \"necessary\" for participants to travel to Rotterdam.\n\nBut contestants will also produce a \"live-on-tape\" performance ahead of the competition, with the videos to be used if artists are unable to travel due to the pandemic, or forced to quarantine at the venue.\n\nEurovision commentators, including Graham Norton, are expected to attend and use ventilated booths.\n\nYep, Flo Rida is actually a part of the Eurovision Song Contest this year\n\nItalian singer Senhit is back to represent the tiny country of San Marino and has enlisted - *checks notes* - Flo Rida for her song, Adrenalina.\n\nThe rapper is no stranger to a pop feature (Olly Murs, The Saturdays, Alexandra Burke) but we're not entirely sure he's even been to San Marino before.\n\nAt this stage it's unlikely he'll appear on the stage on Rotterdam and it's unclear how he'll be represented. Here's hoping for a hologram.\n\nKey lyrics: Flo Rida - \"Step in the party 'cause she nodding to my body like hot coals. Gasoline kerosene stop drop roll. I can't blame it on the stove. 911 when she coming down the pole.\"\n\nDuring the year of a global pandemic, the spotlight's shone on Belarus in a very different way.\n\nThe country has seen mass protests against long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko, following an election which was widely thought to have been rigged.\n\nBelarus' entry is by a band who seem supportive of their leader but their inclusion in the contest is already proving controversial.\n\nEurovision bosses have told the Belarussian broadcaster BTRC that in its current form the song, Ya Nauchu Tebya (I'll Teach You), \"is currently not eligible to compete.\"\n\nEurovision adds: \"The song puts the non-political nature of the contest in question.\"\n\nTo this day, Ireland remains the most successful Eurovision country of all time, with seven wins.\n\nRecent results haven't hit the heights of the multiple wins in the 1990s. However, Jedward were responsible for Ireland's highest-placed finish of the last decade, coming 8th in 2011.\n\nAfter being selected for 2020, Lesley Roy is another singer coming back for the contest and she says her entry Maps was written \"specifically for Eurovision.\"\n\n\"It's heartfelt, it's uplifting and I hope people love it,\" she told independent.ie.\n\nKey lyric: \"My soul is a map, my heart is a compass, I am the road.\"\n\nWith their eccentricity and wonky dancing, The Roop were one of last year's most eye-catching band - and they've stepped it up a notch for 2021.\n\nThe trio are back with the natural follow-up to On Fire, with Discoteque sounding like Hot Chip's Lithuanian cousins.\n\nThey didn't have an easy ride though and still had to go through a national selection show to be picked, choosing a yellow and purple colour scheme this year.\n\nThe Roop say there's \"not a single person who cannot dance.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

            "content": "Four further cases of the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil have been identified in England, bringing the total in the UK to 10.\n\nThree cases of the P.1 variant are in South Gloucestershire and are said to be close or household contacts of the two existing cases in the area.\n\nThe other new case was identified in Bradford.\n\nScientists previously said the variant appears more contagious and there were concerns over its response to vaccines.\n\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said last week it was hoped that vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\n\nThe new Bradford case tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February.\n\nSubsequent genomic sequencing identified the case as the P.1 variant, Public Health England said in a statement.\n\nThousands of positive Covid cases, from all across the UK, are sent for this further sequencing every week as scientists aim to identify any variants of the virus.\n\nThe new South Gloucestershire cases were uncovered when people were offered testing in response to the initial cases found in the area last month - and those who tested positive had their results sent on for further analysis.\n\nSpecialist contact tracing teams are working to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified.\n\nContact-tracers have advised close contacts of the individual in Bradford to isolate and get a test.\n\nThere are now seven cases of the P.1 variant in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil.\n\nIt was always known more cases of the P.1 Brazil variant were coming.\n\nWhen it was confirmed 11 days ago the variant was here, it was known two household members of the original South Gloucestershire cases had tested positive for Covid.\n\nThe results of the genomic sequencing to check which variant they had was not yet complete, but the expectation was it would be P.1.\n\nWhere does this leave us? A quarter of all Covid cases are being checked for variants and all the indications are that they are not spreading.\n\nThe new P.1 cases brings the total to 10, while there have been just over 300 cases of the South African variant and another 113 cases where the UK virus has acquired the E484 mutation which allows it to escape some of the immune response.\n\nThere will be more variants out there that have not been detected, but given that overall week-on-week Covid infection levels are lower we can be confident the variant is not taking hold.\n\nMonitoring this though is crucial to help the UK decide if vaccines updates are needed ahead of next winter.\n\nSeparately, Public Health England said a new variant identified in the UK was designated a \"variant under investigation\" on 4 March. It is not known where this variant first emerged.*\n\nIt said the variant - known as VUI-202103/01 - contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with so-called \"variants of concern\".\n\nBut it added that \"it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a [variant of concern]\".\n\nNo additional cases have yet been found.\n\nIn other developments, rough sleepers and other homeless people in England will be prioritised to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\n\nIt comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people who are homeless or sleeping rough were likely to have underlying health conditions and should be offered jabs alongside those in priority group six - people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.\n\nThey should also be offered the vaccine without the need for an NHS number or GP registration, the JCVI added.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the UK has risen compared with recent days, after a further 6,753 cases were reported, according to the latest data.\n\nAnother 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded.\n\nAs of 10 March, some 23,053,716 people had received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 1,351,515 had received a second dose.\n\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released in February. Three cases were initially found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\n\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London.\n\nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\n\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - prompted intensive tracing efforts in the region as the identity of the person was initially unknown as he or she failed to register their test properly.\n\nBut that person was found at the end of last week and it was confirmed that he or she had \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission.\n\nUnder current Covid restrictions, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK or abroad. Anyone travelling abroad has to fill in a \"Declaration to Travel\" form, stating a valid reason for leaving the country, such as education or work, and journeys within England are only allowed for limited reasons.\n\nThere are also travel bans on 33 countries \"where the risk of a new variant is greatest\", including Brazil and other South American nations.\n\nHowever, the ban on travellers from South America came into effect on 15 February, after one case of the Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. The latest Bradford case is also a person known to have travelled from Brazil via Paris just before that change came in.\n\n*This story has now been updated to reflect new information on UK variants on the Public Health England website. PHE previously reported two cases of the VUI-202103/01 variant had been found in the south-east of England in individuals who had recently been in Antigua. PHE now says: \"Despite the travel history of these cases there is no scientific evidence to determine where this variant first emerged.\"",
