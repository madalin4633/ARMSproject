            "content": "Clive Betts MP says house developers should stop using \"appalling\" gagging orders\n\nHouse builders that carry out repairs on newly built homes need to be more open about what work has been required, according to the chairman of Parliament's Housing Committee.\n\nSome home owners say they were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of repairs being done.\n\nThe Home Builders Federation said NDAs were \"not widely used\" by developers.\n\nMr Betts said housebuilders should be obliged to inform home owners when systematic defects were identified that might affect their property, which he said would be normal practice in other areas.\n\n\"If this kind of thing happens in the car industry, for example, car companies have to tell their customers, issue a recall and get the problem fixed.\n\n\"I don't see why it should be any different when it comes to buying houses,\" he said.\n\nIt is hard to establish an accurate, independent picture of how common such NDAs are. People who have signed them are worried about speaking out because of the threat of legal action.\n\nBut Money Box spoke to several industry experts who said these gagging orders were used regularly.\n\nChris Blythe, former chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Building, said it was \"quite common\" for developers to use them.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because of the nature of the agreement, ie non-disclosure, no-one knows very much about it,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's done for commercial reasons, because if it became known on a particular development that there are problems, other house buyers would be asking the house builder to do remedial work [for them too].\n\n\"So they use these to silence people... and it's a despicable practice.\"\n\nAbout 250,000 new houses were built in Britain, according to the latest annual figures, and defects in new-build houses are common.\n\nMany are minor and fixed without any problems, but serious defects can cost thousands of pounds to put right.\n\nThese include things like poor brickwork, faulty foundations, problems with windows and external doors, structural weaknesses with roofs and issues with plumbing and sewerage systems.\n\nWhen remedial works cost such large sums of money, developers sometimes delay carrying out work, Money Box was told. The programme was also told of cases where developers fought home owners for years and refused to carry out remedial works at all.\n\nGeoff Peter is a solicitor and founded Wingrove Law to help homeowners who bought houses and later discovered serious defects with their properties.\n\n\"Non-disclosure agreements... are of no practical benefit or use to homeowners,\" he said.\n\n\"The effects of them when they're used at scale, as they are in the [house building] industry, is really just to keep a lid on the true nature and scale of problems.\n\n\"So it's really impossible for... the buying public, to have any real idea of the risks they are taking when they buy a new build property... because there's no reliable source of information as to the nature and scale of the problems that they're likely to encounter.\"\n\nWhen asked about NDAs industry body, the Home Builders Federation, said: \"Settlement Agreements are legal contracts that are used by businesses across all sectors.\n\n\"They are not widely used by housebuilders and when they are, it tends to be with regards to details of compensation payments, sometimes at the request of the customer.\"\n\nIf you've been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of getting repair work done to your newbuild house email us in confidence at moneybox@bbc.co.uk and tell us about your experience.\n\nYou can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm on Radio 4 or by listening again here shortly after broadcast.",

            "content": "There are warnings that school funding measures could miss rising levels of need in the pandemic\n\nSchools in England face a \"significant cash loss\" from a change in the date for counting disadvantaged pupils eligible for extra support, says the Education Policy Institute.\n\nThe think tank warns using an earlier cut-off date to count free school meal pupils will miss many who have since become eligible in the pandemic.\n\nThis could lower schools' allocations of \"pupil premium\" funding.\n\nThe Department for Education says an earlier date helps budget planning.\n\nBut head teachers have raised \"grave concerns\" that the change in timing will mean schools serving some of the poorest pupils will miss out on millions in funding, despite rising levels of need.\n\nInstead of using January as the annual point for measuring numbers of pupils eligible for free school meals, the government has used October 2020.\n\nThis has prompted warnings that the earlier date will miss many families caught up in recent months of rising job losses and financial pressures.\n\nIf children are not counted, schools could lose out on pupil premium funding, which is mostly based on their number of pupils eligible for free meals.\n\nPupil premium funding is targeted to help disadvantaged children and provides schools with an extra \u00a31,345 per pupil in primary and \u00a3955 per pupil in secondary.\n\nIn 2020-21, more than two million children were supported with pupil premium funding worth \u00a32.4bn. This is expected to rise to \u00a32.5bn next year - but there are concerns the change in the date could undercount the need.\n\n\"This policy change looks to be poorly timed and is likely to have huge ramifications,\" said Natalie Perera, Education Policy Institute chief executive.\n\n\"Given that there was a likely rise in pupil premium eligibility during this period due to the recession and rises in unemployment caused by the pandemic, this could represent a significant cash loss for schools,\" she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Association of Head Teachers said this was of \"grave concern to school leaders across the country\".\n\n\"We expect the consequences of this change to be significant,\" she said.\n\nThe impact would not be evenly spread - as pupil premium funding is a much bigger factor in more disadvantaged areas.\n\nIn parts of inner London, Birmingham, Manchester, Merseyside and Teesside more than 40% of pupils are eligible, based on deprivation. In Buckinghamshire it is about 13%.\n\nPupil premium was worth about \u00a395m to schools in Birmingham last year, compared with \u00a33.6m in Windsor and Maidenhead.\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, has backed the warnings.\n\n\"It is imperative that no school should lose out in receiving pupil premium funding as a result of this administrative change,\" said Judith Blake, chair of the LGA's children and young people board.\n\nShe said this was particularly important \"in the context of the pandemic and the need to ensure pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are supported to recover lost education\".\n\n\"There will be many schools with children who will have become eligible for pupil premium between October and January who will now not qualify for this extra funding for a whole year,\" said Cllr Blake.\n\nThe Harris Federation academy trust, with 50 schools mostly in and around London, said more than 500 of its pupils became eligible for pupil premium funding in the gap between the two dates.\n\nLast month, Tony Foot, the Department for Education's director of strategic finance, told the Education Select Committee that he did \"not recognise\" claims the change in date would save \u00a3150m - and said: \"I do not have a figure for savings that are associated with that change.\"\n\nHe told MPs it would align pupil premium with core funding, which operates on an October census, and would provide certainty on funding at an earlier point.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"We are committed to ensuring all children have access to good quality education, no matter their background.\n\n\"Using the October census for pupil premium allocation means schools will know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead and we expect pupil premium funding to increase to more than \u00a32.5bn in 2021-22.\"\n\nSchools will also have extra support from \u00a31.7bn in catch-up funding to help recover from the disruption of the pandemic.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Maya Tutton and her sister Gemma campaign against street harassment\n\nThe case of Sarah Everard has prompted many women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe while walking the streets.\n\nAs the 33-year-old was last seen walking home in the dark from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, it has sparked discussion on social media about the precautions women are taking when they go out alone - from not wearing headphones to telling friends where they are going.\n\nBut how can we help women feel safer without them having to change their own behaviour?\n\nMaya Tutton, 22, says that her first experience of street harassment was when she was still at school, recalling: \"I remember one particular incident when I was 14 and several men pulled up next to me with two friends and they made some of the most sexually threatening comments I had heard in my life.\n\n\"And I remember just being so scared and never feeling the same way in public spaces again.\"\n\nBut it was her younger sister Gemma's experiences that pushed her to take action.\n\n\"At the age of 11 she was out on a summer day and a man pulled up and shouted horrible sexual comments about her body and her legs and she came back to me and she spoke to me about it,\" she says.\n\n\"And I had to explain to her firstly that this had become a normal part of being a girl - that this was unremarkable somehow and that this probably wouldn't be the only incident. And on top of that, this probably wouldn't be the worst incident.\"\n\nTwo years ago the pair, who live in south-east England, founded Our Streets Now, which campaigns for public sexual harassment to be a criminal offence as well as for the issue to be part of the secondary school curriculum.\n\nThe group has also created free lesson plans and resources for teachers to educate girls - and boys - about public sexual harassment.\n\nEngaging boys and men is crucial, Maya says, adding: \"We cannot continue to place the onus on the victim's shoulders.\"\n\nWhen women are told to change their behaviour to stay safe, perpetrators are still a danger to others, she explains.\n\n\"The onus should never be on us to change things,\" Maya says. \"We're not tackling the root and the root is male violence.\"\n\nChris Green founded White Ribbon UK, which works to end male violence against women\n\nThe importance of men in tackling violence against women is also central to the work of the White Ribbon UK charity.\n\n\"It is men's responsibility to challenge other men and ourselves in our behaviours,\" says founder Chris Green.\n\nThe global movement began in Canada in the 1990s and works to engage men and boys across society to make a stand on the issue.\n\n\"It is a pledge never to commit the violence, never to excuse the violence and never to remain silent about the epidemic levels of violence in our society,\" Chris, 67, explains.\n\nThe charity works with organisations including schools, councils, police forces and universities to provide resources to raise awareness and educate men about violence against women.\n\nChris noticed there was a \"groundswell\" of reaction on social media from women since the Sarah Everard case started being talked about - with some asking why more men weren't \"shouting about\" the issue of women's safety.\n\n\"It just says to me we should be doing more,\" he adds.\n\nKerry Lindeque is campaigning for parks in Sheffield to have better lighting\n\nIn Sheffield, Our Bodies Our Streets campaigns on practical ways to help women feel safer.\n\nA petition launched by the group earlier this year, calling for the council to improve lighting in the city's parks, has attracted more than 3,000 signatures.\n\nKerry Lindeque, a member of the group who is studying at the University of Sheffield, says: \"Everybody has the right to exercise and everybody should have the right to go for a walk, especially in lockdown because it's so important and has such a big impact on our mental health.\n\n\"But as soon as it gets dark a lot of women don't feel safe on the streets because you have people stalking you, you have people catcalling you, you have cars driving slowly past you.\"\n\nShe said that those who decide to go into parks to avoid those slow-driving cars then don't feel the parks are particularly safe either.\n\nThe group have also created an online map, documenting people's experiences of harassment in Sheffield.\n\nKerry, 20, says the aim is to \"validate\" people's experiences so they feel listened to, as well as to highlight the extent of the problem.\n\nMore than 10,000 people have also shared their experiences of harassment with the Catcalls of London Instagram page, which writes examples of catcalling in chalk on the streets where they happened.\n\nThe movement first started in the New York and has spread to cities around the world, including London, where an account was started by Farah Benis three years ago.\n\nThe 34-year-old says she was inspired by her own experiences of harassment from the age of 11 and \"the fact that every single woman I know has experienced it in some form multiple times\".\n\n\"I wanted to scream about it and I founded Catcalls of London instead.\"\n\nOut of the thousands of submissions the account has received, Farah says 74% are from under-18s, while experiences range from verbal threats to groping.\n\nShe highlights how, in many cases, unwanted attention can escalate to aggression.\n\n\"That's what happens when men don't get the reaction they want - they lash out,\" she says.\n\nFarah hopes the account will raise awareness and help bring about change.\n\n\"When we stop accepting things as the norm and start to challenge them it wakes people up, especially people who are not affected by these issues, to the impact they have on us - our mental health, our wellbeing, the constant worry about our personal safety,\" she says.\n\n\"These are all things that so many men don't realise we experience.\"",

It often involves supporting older people with washing, dressing and eating, and helps younger adults with learning disabilities with day-to-day activities and tasks.\n\nOf the respondents, 15% said they felt neglected and 18% reported feeling scared about the care they received during the pandemic.\n\nOf people with learning disabilities, 34% said they felt lonely or isolated and 25% had not been able to leave the house due to a lack of support.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, CSA co-chairwoman and charity director at Age UK, said: \"Our new survey shows how a lack of social care during the pandemic has diminished the lives of many older and disabled people, and their unpaid carers, and put their health at risk.\n\n\"This has piled further pressure on the NHS when this was the last thing our over-stretched health services needed.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has promised a \"sustainable\" plan for the sector with long-lasting reforms.\n\nIn July, the head of NHS England warned that plans to adequately fund the social care sector needed to be put in place within a year.\n\nServices in the sector have been stretched over the years due to government funding cuts and growing demands linked to an ageing population.\n\nSocial care is not usually provided for free, with the UK nations differing in their approach.\n\nIn England, anyone with assets over \u00a323,250 is expected to pay for some or all of their costs.",

The duchess is also reported to have complained to ITV directly.\n\nOn the programme, Morgan picked up on Meghan's claim in the interview that her request to senior Buckingham Palace officials for help was rejected, after she told Oprah she had experienced suicidal thoughts.\n\n\"Who did you go to?\" he said. \"What did they say to you? I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she said, Meghan Markle. I wouldn't believe it if she read me a weather report.\n\n\"The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible.\"\n\nOn Tuesday's episode, Morgan briefly walked out of the studio after clashing with weather presenter Alex Beresford during a discussion about the interview.\n\nThe controversial host's permanent departure was announced that evening. Morgan stood by his comments the following day, saying: \"Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on.\"\n\nIt was also announced on Friday that the duke and duchess have donated to a new charity that aims to help young people from diverse backgrounds get into journalism.\n\nThe PressPad Charitable Foundation has been set up to \"improve social mobility\" in the British media through bursaries, mentoring, networking and accommodation.\n\nThe duke and duchess's Archewell Foundation is among the first donors, but it is not known how much money the couple have contributed.\n\nPressPad founder Olivia Crellin told BBC News the charity had been approached by the Sussex's team \"very recently\".\n\n\"They just wanted to give a gift as a part of a couple of organisations that they are donating to,\" she said. \"They felt that our mission and our values aligned with theirs.\"\n\nPrince Harry told Oprah the UK tabloid press was \"bigoted\" and creates a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\".\n\nThe couple's interview has sparked scrutiny of the media and the role race has played in its coverage of Meghan.\n\nMeanwhile, Daily Mail and Mail Online owner Associated Newspapers is reported to have written to ViacomCBS, the makers of the interview, to complain that there was \"deliberate distortion and doctoring\" in a \"misleading\" montage of British newspaper headlines that was used in the programme.\n\nMeghan recently won a High Court privacy case against Associated Newspapers over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "section": "Northern Ireland",
            "content": "Sinn F\u00e9in has refused to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his visit to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe party described his trip on Friday as a publicity stunt.\n\nMr Johnson said he was \"always happy to meet all sides\" but had been told Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn F\u00e9in was \"otherwise engaged\".\n\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster urged him ditch what she called the \"intolerable\" post-Brexit arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nIt came into effect in January as part of the Brexit deal and means Northern Ireland remains in the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK has left, so checks are required on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Mrs Foster said the protocol was unworkable, had the backing of no unionist parties and created societal division and economic harm rather than protecting the Belfast Agreement that effectively brought to an end Northern Ireland's Troubles.\n\n\"Whilst grace periods have been extended unilaterally, we need a permanent solution so business can plan and the integrity of the United Kingdom internal market can be restored,\" said Mrs Foster, speaking after meeting the prime minister at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.\n\nMr Johnson said the government's action to postpone the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol was \"lawful and indeed right in view of the impact on the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and the need to have consent from both communities\".\n\n\"The most important thing about the protocol is that it should guarantee the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"There's got to be an east-west consent... as well as a north-south consent so that's what we're doing.\"\n\nMs O'Neill, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, said she and her party's president Mary Lou McDonald had a \"long-standing request\" to meet Mr Johnson.\n\nBoris Johnson arrived at the vaccination centre at Fermanagh Lakeland Forum with NI Secretary Brandon Lewis\n\nThey wanted to discuss \"commitments which he and his government have reneged on\" as well as his \"reckless and partisan approach to the Irish protocol\", she said.\n\n\"He did not facilitate the meeting,\" added Ms O'Neill. \"I have no plans to meet with him today.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MP John Finucane went further, describing the prime minister's visit as a \"very superficial PR exercise\".\n\nThis visit feels like the first step in the prime minister's own pathway to recovery as he seeks to repair badly damaged relations with unionists.\n\nIt was no surprise that pathway included an early trip to Fermanagh - the home of Arlene Foster.\n\nEven before he arrived, his advance party had set the stage releasing details of events to mark Northern Ireland's centenary.\n\nBut it will take more than a special postmark, a concert and a centenary rose to heal the unionist hurt.\n\nFar from being the union's chief cheerleader, Boris Johnson is regarded by many unionists as the prime minister who betrayed Northern Ireland by agreeing to the protocol which created the Irish Sea border.\n\nIt is going to be a tricky visit for the prime minister labelled a \"lousy unionist\" by an Orange Order leader.\n\nIt is no surprise that much of the visit's focus was on the battle against Covid-19 and the successful rollout of the UK's vaccine programme.\n\nBut until he comes up with a political vaccine to eradicate the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Boris Johnson pathway to unionist recovery will not be smooth.\n\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the success of Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine programme \"shows the strength of the union\".\n\nBut the UUP MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) warned that the Northern Ireland Protocol had brought challenges, particularly in terms of medical supplies.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mr Johnson commended the military and emergency response teams at Aldergrove in County Antrim for their work throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nArmy medics were deployed to hospitals in Northern Ireland to assist staff dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases over the winter.\n\nMr Johnson thanked them for their \"incredible\" work in Belfast's Nightingale Hospital, where some of them gave patient care.\n\nThe prime minister also met scientists involved in vaccine research at Queen's University Belfast.\n\nHis last engagement in Northern Ireland was at medical 3D printing company Axial 3D in Belfast on Friday evening.\n\nThe prime minister last visited Northern Ireland in August - his first trip since power sharing was restored in January 2020 after a three-year hiatus.\n\nOn that trip, he held talks with Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill at Hillsborough Castle and also addressed criticism of plans to celebrate Northern Ireland's centenary.\n\nBefore his visit on Friday, Mr Johnson announced official events to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said the events would reflect on what made Northern Ireland \"the great place it is today\".",

            "section": "Wales",
            "content": "Skye is concerned about the impact of plastic on the environment\n\nA 10-year-old girl is campaigning to stop plastic toys being included in children's magazines amid concerns about the impact on climate change.\n\nSkye, from Gwynedd, launched a petition after becoming fed up with being sent \"cheap plastic rubbish\" with her favourite magazine.\n\nShe was concerned the toys were creating a large carbon footprint and ending up in landfill.\n\nThe Welsh Government said her bid could help Wales to become waste free.\n\nIt comes after Burger King stopped including plastic toys in their children's meals and McDonald's gave children options of books with Happy Meals, after a campaign by two sisters.\n\nSkye, who often litter picks in her village near Fairbourne, wrote to publishers to urge them to stop using single-use plastic in one of her favourite magazines Horrible Histories.\n\n\"It's utter rubbish,\" she said, \"it not only comes in a plastic bag, it has plastic blister packaging and there are the free gifts.\"\n\nSkye said many of the plastic toys, were \"pointless\", including a skeleton pen, which \"you can't even write with\", a rubber tongue, brain, rats, maggots or slime that breaks.\n\nSkye said many children's magazines came with toys which could not be recycled\n\nIn a response to her letter, Kennedy Publishers, said they were \"working very hard to make their magazines environmentally friendly\", and the magazines were made from paper from sustainable forests, while the packaging was made using recyclable materials.\n\nIt said the plastic toys were recyclable in \"some areas\" and were an important part of the magazine and not intended for single use.\n\nBut Skye said she would like to see the toys removed altogether and all magazines made from paper, unwrapped or wrapped in paper, to reduce excess packaging.\n\n\"If you saw it in a toy department you wouldn't buy it,\" said Skye, who keeps the toys in a box to show people how many she is sent, rather than throwing them away.\n\n\"I've got gazillions of fake teeth and rubber maggots... they're not good for playing a prank, they don't look real. I've had three pots of slime and it's rubbish, it breaks.\"\n\nPeppa Pig, LOL Dolls, My Little Pony and Mr Men are just some of the children's magazines which often come with free plastic toys.\n\n\"These toys will be made in China, wrapped in plastic, put on a pallet wrapped in more plastic, sent across the world, unwrapped, stuck on a magazine and covered in more plastic, and then shipped to houses,\" Skye said.\n\n\"The carbon footprint is big and you are putting it straight in the bin to pollute the planet.\"\n\nSkye's campaign has been supported by politicians, Surfers Against Sewage and Kids Against Plastic\n\nSkye's father Dave, a postman, said he was also concerned about the amount of plastic wrapping used on magazines aimed at adults which he delivers on his rounds.\n\n\"I just remember Skye getting this [magazine] through the doors and she said \"that's it\" and then writing to the publisher,\" he said.\n\n\"We try to recycle everything we can... if we see litter we pick it up. We just want the publishers to do their bit.\"\n\nAfter her petition calling for the toys to be scrapped attracted almost 3,000 signatures, politicians have stepped in to help and her campaign has been raised in Parliament.\n\nSkye is now preparing to write to every school in Wales to highlight the issue.\n\nWelsh Government minister Eluned Morgan has written to magazine publishers, while Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts raised the matter in the House of Commons.\n\n\"These toys are marketed at children, whose environmental future we are trying to protect,\" said Ms Morgan.\n\n\"Some plastics can last decades - if not centuries - in our environment. They should be environmentally friendly and serve an educational purpose.\"\n\nMs Morgan said the campaign was especially \"poignant\", coming from a child living in a coastal community threatened by climate change.\n\nSea defences at Fairbourne will stop being maintained in the 2050s and Gwynedd council has said it may begin moving out villagers before then.\n\nThe Welsh Government has committed to \"phasing out unnecessary single-use items, especially plastic\", in a bid to become a zero waste nation by 2050.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"Young people like Skye can help to change attitudes, so we can all start making the changes needed for us to reach our goal of becoming a zero waste nation by 2050.\n\n\"We are also working alongside other administrations in the UK - including the UK government - on proposed reforms for extended producer responsibility (EPR), under which packaging producers would be required to pay net costs for managing any plastic waste they create.\n\n\"This would include plastic wrapping used to package magazines.\"",

            "content": "Students at the University of Manchester have passed a vote of no confidence in its vice-chancellor.\n\nDame Nancy Rothwell faced opposition over the university's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAbout 89% of the students who took part in the non-binding vote agreed the student body had \"no confidence\" in the vice-chancellor and other leaders.\n\nThe university said the vote had a 13% turnout and said it had \"full confidence\" in Dame Nancy.\n\nA spokesperson for the student-led campaign group said the positions of the vice-chancellor and her team had become \"completely untenable\".\n\n\"It's apparent to anyone that the mistreatment of students and mishandling of the pandemic by the university over the past year has become an exemplar of how not to run a university,\" they said.\n\nUniversity and College Union (UCU) general secretary Jo Grady said the \"overwhelming vote\" was \"no surprise\" and said Dame Nancy had treated students \"shamefully.\"\n\n\"She irresponsibly brought students back to campus to secure income from fees and rent and then locked them in their accommodation,\" she said.\n\nIn November, Dame Nancy told BBC Newsnight she had apologised in writing to 19-year-old student Zach Adan, who was allegedly racially profiled by security guards as he returned to his halls of residence.\n\nWhen it emerged that this had not happened, she apologised again, saying she was \"devastated that I made the wrong remark on national television\" and had \"written to sincerely apologise to the student\".\n\nThe incident came amid ongoing protests by students who were campaigning for rent reductions after their face-to-face classes were halted.\n\nProtests also erupted on campus during the autumn term as the second lockdown began when a wire fence was erected overnight around accommodation without students being consulted.\n\nStudents pulled down the barriers on the University of Manchester's Fallowfield campus in protest.\n\nThe referendum was held by the students' union after a petition met the threshold number of signatures to trigger a vote.\n\nIn a statement, the university's board of governors said it had \"full confidence\" in the senior leadership \"to lead the university forward\".\n\n\"Whilst our senior leaders haven't got everything right, where that has been the case, they have led from the front by apologising and have always taken action to ensure lessons are learnt and improvements are made,\" they said.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

There have now been 143,259 deaths, according to the latest figures.\n\nSince then there have been three periods of national restrictions, as well as the introduction of levels and tiers of measures in all four nations.\n\nThe past 12 months have also seen coronavirus vaccines developed from scratch, with 23.3m people in the UK having now received a first dose.\n\nThe prime minister said he would observe the minute's silence at noon privately.\n\nOther senior politicians have given their support to the event, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford all saying they would take part.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"This has been an incredibly difficult year for our country. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones, and who have not been able to pay tribute to them in the way they would have wanted.\n\n\"As we continue to make progress against the virus, I want to thank people for the sacrifices they continue to make, and hope they can look forward to being reunited with loved ones as restrictions are cautiously eased.\"\n\nAlongside the minute's silence and doorstep vigil, the day will also see community-led activities take place, such as virtual assemblies, choirs, services and yellow ribbons being wrapped around trees.\n\nA series of free online talks organised by the Good Grief Festival will also take place, featuring experts, bereaved families and celebrities.\n\nIt is hoped people will help create a nationwide \"beacon of remembrance\" on their doorsteps by beaming phones, candles and torches into the night sky at 20:00.\n\nMarie Curie chief executive Matthew Reed said it was \"important that we all come together to reflect on our collective loss, celebrate the lives of the special people no longer here, support those who've been bereaved and look towards a much brighter future\".\n\nPlease enable JavaScript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive",

            "content": "More than 3,000 UK email servers remain at risk from the global Microsoft Exchange email flaw, officials believe.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured.\n\nIt said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it.\n\nThe agency said it was \"vital\" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers.\n\nThe announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week.\n\nRansomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far.\n\nOnce installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data.\n\nThe security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system, which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide.\n\nThe NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue.\n\nInitially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data.\n\nBut after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw.\n\nThe result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack.\n\n\"We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,\" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned.\n\n\"While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates.\"\n\nHe also urged all organisations to \"familiarise\" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised.\n\nThe true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone.\n\nWhat is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact.\n\nWhile many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low.\n\nThat may change in the coming days as more reports come in.\n\nWhat is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.",
