            "content": "China has forcibly separated Uighur families by taking young children into state orphanages, according to human rights group Amnesty International.\n\nIn a new report, Amnesty has called on China to release all Uighur children being held in orphanages without the consent of their families.\n\nThe charity spoke to parents who left children with relatives in China when they were forced to flee the country.\n\nRights groups say China has detained more than a million Uighurs.\n\nThe Chinese government has also faced allegations of a wide range of human rights abuses against the Uighur people and other Muslim minorities, including forced labour, forced sterilisation, sexual abuse and rape.\n\nThe government denies it is holding Uighurs in detention camps in the Xinjiang region in north-western China. It says the camps are \"re-education\" facilities being used to combat terrorism.\n\nBecause access to Xinjiang is heavily restricted by the Chinese, Amnesty spoke to Uighurs who were able to flee Xinjiang before the repression of the Uighur people intensified in 2017.\n\nMihriban Kader and Ablikim Memtinin fled from Xinjiang to Italy in 2016 after being harassed by police and pressured to give up their passports, Amnesty said. They left four children in the temporary care of grandparents, but the grandmother was taken to a detention camp while the grandfather was interrogated by police, the charity said.\n\n\"Our other relatives didn't dare to look after my children after what had happened to my parents,\" Mihriban told Amnesty. \"They were afraid that they would be sent to camps, too.\"\n\nIn November 2019, Mihriban and Ablikim received a permit from the Italian government to bring their children to join them, but the children were seized by Chinese police on the way and sent to a state-run orphanage, Amnesty said.\n\n\"Now my children are in the hands of the Chinese government and I am not sure I will be able to meet them again in my lifetime,\" Mihriban said.\n\nOmer and Meryem Faruh, who fled to Turkey in late 2016, left their two youngest children, aged five and six, with grandparents because they did not yet have their own travel documents, Amnesty said. They found out later that the grandparents had been arrested and sent to a camp and have not heard from their children since.\n\nAmnesty's report calls on China to provide full and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for UN human rights experts, independent researchers and journalists, and for all children held without their parents consent to be released to family.\n\n\"China's ruthless mass detention campaign in Xinjiang has put separated families in an impossible situation: children are not allowed to leave, but their parents face persecution and arbitrary detention if they attempt to return home to care for them,\" said Alkan Akad, Amnesty International's China researcher.\n\nThe Chinese state has created a vast and secretive network of camps in Xinjiang and is estimated to have detained more than a million Uighurs and people from other Muslim minority groups.\n\nReports have emerged in recent years of appalling human rights abuses, from forced sterilisation of Uighur women to torture and systematic rape inside camps.\n\nChina denies there are any human rights abuses taking place, and has called former camp detainees in exile liars and actors. China is also accused of intimidating and smearing witnesses who have spoken up, and of using witnesses's relatives in Xinjiang as leverage against them.\n\nThe US, Canada, and the Netherlands have declared that China is committing a genocide against the Uighur people. A similar bill was rejected by the UK parliament.",

            "description": "Pupils will learn about historical and current diversity under the new curriculum.",
            "section": "Wales",
            "content": "Black history lessons to be made mandatory in Welsh schools\n\nAll children will be taught about racism and the contributions of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities, the education minister said.\n\nAlmost 35,000 people have called for Britain's colonial past to be taught in school lessons.\n\nUnder changes to the new curriculum the teaching of BAME histories will be mandatory, Kirsty Williams said.\n\nMs Williams said it would help pupils become \"informed citizens of the world\".\n\nHowever, Plaid Cymru argued the changes were not included in the school curriculum law, passed in the Senedd last week, but instead in a code which could be changed or got rid of by ministers.\n\nThe Welsh government said this was \"incorrect\" and the teaching of BAME stories would be required in every school.\n\nWales' new curriculum, set to be introduced in 2022, is based on six \"areas of learning and experience\" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching.\n\nHowever, the changes will now mean all learning areas will need to reflect the diverse experiences and contributions of BAME communities and individuals to both past and present Wales.\n\nFollowing worldwide protests after the death of George Floyd in US police custody, there were calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools.\n\nProf Charlotte Williams, who led a working group set up by the Welsh government to look at how BAME contributions through history was taught in schools, said there was considerable evidence of \"racial inequality\" in Wales' education system.\n\nShe said the new curriculum was an opportunity for \"significant change\", and it was the right of \"every child to learn about histories and contributions that have shaped the Welsh nation\".\n\nProf Charlotte Williams said children needed to learn about diverse role models and histories regardless of where they lived\n\nIn a report published on Friday, Prof Williams said with schools able to set their own curriculum under the national framework BAME histories could \"continue to be marginalised or ignored\", unless made mandatory.\n\nWhile learning about diversity, identity and equality is mandatory under the new curriculum, there is no requirement for schools to teach pupils about slavery, the British Empire, or the Holocaust, Ms Williams writes.\n\nProf Williams said this was concerning as these areas were \"topics of central understanding to the histories of racism and diversity\".\n\nIn 2019, 12% of all pupils aged five and over came from minority ethnic backgrounds, but this differs widely across Wales, from 34.4% in Cardiff to 4.1% in Anglesey, according to Pupil Level Annual School Census data.\n\nFewer than 1% of teachers in Wales say they are black, Asian, or from other or mixed minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2019-20 school workforce census.\n\nForty of the 1,065 students who began training to become teachers in Wales in 2018-19 said they were from a minority ethnic group.\n\nProf Williams, who has previously spoken about growing up in Llandudno where her family were the only black family, said children were being \"failed\" by a lack of positive role models in schools and a curriculum that did not represent their histories.\n\nShe said all children should be able to learn about diverse history and talent regardless of their background or where they lived.\n\nThe report states that current resources to support the teaching of ethnic minority themes is disproportionately focused on slavery, colonialism and Empire, and that positive contributions and role models needed to be celebrated.\n\nThe report makes 51 recommendations for changes in the new curriculum and teacher training including:\n\nThe Welsh government has said all of the recommendations in the report had been accepted, and it had allocated \u00a3500,000 to help with their implementation.\n\nMs Williams said: \"Our new curriculum can only be enriched by revealing the diversity of perspectives and contributions made by the ethnic minority communities to the development of Wales across its history and in the present.\"\n\nAngel, a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, had campaigned for black history to be included in the curriculum\n\nAngel Ezeadum, member of UK Youth Parliament for Cardiff, said it was a relief that \"finally we are doing something\" to tackle racism and inequality.\n\nThe 16-year-old student said she hoped the changes would lead to the next generation of pupils having more opportunity to have a \"different mindset to perhaps their parents or grandparents\".\n\n\"If we want a society which is better for all, where there's equality, and there's fair representation then we need this,\" she said.\n\n\"It's massive in terms of shaping who young people are going to be in the future whether that's a police officer, a teacher, a politician.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said that schools were not required to deliver Welsh history under the newly-passed curriculum law, which was a \"major flaw\".\n\nWhile teaching humanities is one of the learning areas under law, Welsh history and the teaching of BAME stories is included in statutory guidance, called the What Matters Code.\n\n\"It has the potential of being transformational in the way our society is developing...and it has been left out [of the law],\" Ms Gwenllian said.\n\n\"It has to be mandatory in our schools, otherwise we are not going to be equipping our young people with the information that they want, with the knowledge about where we have come from as a people and as a nation.\"\n\nHowever, the Welsh government said the What Matters Code was mandatory and must be taught to all pupils.\n\n\"It is incorrect to claim otherwise,\" a spokesman said.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "First-year bankers at investment bank Goldman Sachs have warned that they might quit unless their gruelling working conditions improve.\n\nAn internal survey among 13 employees showed they averaged 95 hours of work a week and slept five hours a night.\n\nTheir personal relationships also suffered as did their physical and mental health.\n\nThe analysts warned that they would be likely to leave within six months unless things changed.\n\nThe survey offers a rare glimpse into the fiercely competitive work culture of Wall Street's top firms, where junior analysts scramble for well-paid career paths.\n\nThe survey, which began circulating on social media on Wednesday, is presented on Goldman Sachs-branded slides that note they were produced within the investment banking division.\n\nBut the BBC understands that the survey was conducted by a \"self-selected\" group of US-based first-year investment banking analysts among themselves.\n\n\"The sleep deprivation, the treatment by senior bankers, the mental and physical stress\u2026 I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse,\" one respondent said in the survey, which has been seen by the BBC.\n\n\"This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,\" said another.\n\nAll of the respondents said the job had negatively affected their relationships with friends and family, while 77% said they had been victims of workplace abuse.\n\nIt's not just those in the world of finance who endure long days and little sleep.\n\nDavid works in software development. Before the pandemic he would travel from his home in Torquay in Devon to London on a Sunday night and only return on Friday evening - sometimes not getting through the door before midnight.\n\nOn top of his full-time job, he always has a side project that can keep him up until 02:00 and intrudes on weekends.\n\nHe says his wife would describe him as a workaholic but he doesn't use the term himself.\n\n\"I'm definitely the kind of person who would sleep less if I could,\" David says. \"It's wasted time.\"\n\nBefore working for the firm, the analysts assessed their own mental health at 8.8 out of 10 and their physical health at 9 out of 10.\n\nAfter starting the job, they rated their mental health at 2.8 and their physical health at 2.3.\n\n83% said they had experienced \"excessive monitoring or micromanagement\", while 17% said they frequently experienced shouting or swearing.\n\nThe survey recommended maximum 80-hour work weeks with no work on Saturday or after 9pm on Friday.\n\nIt also urged more realistic deadlines and better work flows aimed at reducing stress.\n\nThe analysts presented their findings to Goldman Sachs' management in February, and the bank said it has since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and wider teams.\n\n\"We recognise that our people are very busy, because business is strong and volumes are at historic levels,\" the bank's spokeswoman Nicole Sharpe told the BBC.\n\n\"A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.\"\n\nThe bank says it has been reinforcing its \"Saturday Exception\" policy and moving to automate certain tasks for junior staff.",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "The UK death rate during the second wave of the pandemic was not the worst in Europe - but it remained one of the 10 worst-affected countries.\n\nBy the end of June 2020, the UK had the highest excess mortality in Europe, according to figures from the ONS.\n\nBut by December it had been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.\n\nNevertheless, the UK had one of the highest excess death rates among people under the age of 65 in 2020 at 7.7%.\n\nExcess mortality is the number of deaths by any cause that happen over and above the average for that time of year.\n\nMeanwhile, the government's separate daily UK coronavirus figures show the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test are continuing to fall.\n\nOn Friday, the UK reported a further 101 deaths and 4,802 cases, according to the data. Last Friday, 175 deaths and 6,609 cases were recorded.\n\nThe UK saw 7% more deaths than normally expected during 2020. Within the UK, England's death rate was 8% above expected levels across the whole year, Scotland's was 6%, Northern Ireland 5% and Wales 4%.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics figures cover up to 18 December so do not include deaths from this year. About a third of the UK's Covid deaths have happened since then.\n\nOnly Bulgaria recorded a higher rate for under-65s - 12.3% - among the countries analysed by the ONS.\n\nDr Annie Campbell, from the ONS, said the figures showed the pandemic had not \"exclusively\" affected the oldest age groups in the UK.\n\nFor deaths among all age groups Poland ended 2020 with the highest rate (11.6% above the five-year average), followed by Spain (10.6%) and Belgium (9.7%).\n\nEngland ranked seventh on this list (7.8%) with the UK eighth (7.2%).\n\nAll-cause mortality allows countries to be compared more easily, even if they record Covid-19 deaths in different ways. It also reflects the indirect impact of the pandemic, such as deaths from other causes that might be related to delayed access to treatment.\n\nThe figures also take account of the average age of a country's population and the average level of deaths in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, separate ONS figures suggest infection levels have continued to decrease across England and Wales but have \"levelled off\" in Northern Ireland and increased in Scotland.\n\nAn estimated one in 335 people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week to 13 March, according to the figures, down from one in 280 last week.\n\nIn England, the figure is at its lowest since the week to 24 September, when the estimate stood at one in 470.\n\nThe ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, also show:\n\nThe falls in England were driven by falls in the West Midlands, the East, South West and London, the ONS said. The rest of England has seen little change in infection rates and there are hints of an increase in the East Midlands.\n\nThe ONS said infections among secondary aged children had decreased and \"appear to be levelling\" for primary aged children.\n\nHowever, it said the figures were from the first week since schools returned in England and therefore it was too early to say whether this had influenced infection rates.\n\nThe latest R number - which represents the average number people each infected person passes the virus on to - is between 0.6 and 0.9, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.\n\nLast week the figure was estimated at between 0.6 and 0.8.\n\nWhen the figure is above one, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below one, it means the epidemic is shrinking.\n\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to receive his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after reassuring the public it was safe.\n\nSeveral European countries are to resume using the AstraZeneca jab after the European Medicines Agency confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\n\nThe regulator reviewed the vaccine amid fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with an increased risk of clots and the benefits outweighed any risks.",

            "content": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, Boris Johnson has said, adding he will be receiving it himself on Friday.\n\nThe benefits of the vaccine preventing Covid far outweighed any risks, the prime minister said, as he urged people to take up the jab when offered.\n\nIt comes after UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots.\n\nMr Johnson also said delays to vaccine supply next month would not affect England's roadmap out of lockdown.\n\n\"The progress along the road to freedom remains unchecked,\" he told a Downing Street briefing, after NHS England warned vaccine supplies would be reduced in April.\n\nProf Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told the briefing the Covid vaccines were \"very effective\" against what remained a \"very dangerous disease for many people\".\n\nHe added that there were \"real issues that we always have to think about with all drugs\", but they were \"so much smaller than the benefits of getting the vaccine\".\n\n\"The risk-benefit is really strongly in favour of getting vaccinated,\" he said.\n\nRegulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain, prompting some European countries to pause rollout.\n\nBut earlier, the MHRA and the EMA said people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised.\n\nFrance and Italy have since announced that they will resume using the jab.\n\nA phrase used repeatedly today is the risk-benefit ratio. But what does that mean?\n\nThe EU and UK regulators were unable to completely rule out the vaccine as a cause of rare blood clots that have been seen.\n\nBecause the clots are so rare, it is hard to tell if they are above the levels you would normally expect without vaccination.\n\nBut even if a link is proven - and there is no suggestion it will be - the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.\n\nThere have been 18 cases of this rare blood clot out of 20 million vaccinations in Europe. That's about one in a million.\n\nSomeone who is over the age of 75 and becomes infected with Covid has a one in nine chance of dying.\n\nEven in younger age groups the benefits are clear. Someone in their 40s has a one in 1,000 risk of dying.\n\nThe vaccines have been proved to be highly effective. They will save lives, rather than cost them.\n\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Johnson confirmed that supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been affected by a delayed shipment from the Serum Institute of India.\n\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\n\n\"There is a delay as I have described, as there are very frequently in vaccine rollout programmes,\" he said.\n\nHe put it down to \"various technical reasons\" and said the Indian government \"hasn't stopped any export\".\n\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\n\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest held up by four weeks.\n\nThe Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\n\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\n\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters.",

            "content": "An infection \"probably\" linked to Glasgow's children's hospital was the \"primary cause of death\" of a young cancer patient, the BBC has learned.\n\nInfections from contaminated water at the hospital were also found to have been an \"important contributory factor\" in another child's death.\n\nA review looked into the cases of 84 children who developed infections while undergoing treatment at the hospital.\n\nIt found that a third of infections \"probably\" originated in the hospital.\n\nAnd it said the rest were \"possibly\" acquired there.\n\nThe authors of the \"case note review\", which should be published next week, said they recognised that some families would be disappointed that they could not have \"greater certainty\" about the links between their child's infection and the hospital environment.\n\nThey said this was down to the limits of a retrospective review but also criticised the shortcomings in the data provided by the health board.\n\nThe review was commissioned by the health secretary as part of wider investigations into problems with the drainage and ventilation system at the \u00a3850m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children.\n\nAn official probe found \"widespread contamination\" in the water supply, with at least 23 children contracting bloodstream infections in the cancer wards in 2018.\n\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was placed in \"special measures\" in November 2019 and in January last year two experts were appointed to oversee a review of infections.\n\nAmong them was 10-year-old Milly Main who died in August 2017.\n\nMilly, who had leukaemia, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 and was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died some days later.\n\nHer death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death but her mother Kimberley Darroch says the family were kept in the dark about a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital.\n\nThe health board previously insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time.\n\nThe case note review looked at how many children were affected by a particular type of serious infection caused by Gram-negative environmental (GNE) bacteria between 2015 and 2019.\n\nIt then looked to see whether it was possible to link these to the hospital environment.\n\nThe review does not name the children it investigated.\n\nBut it does say that one child was in the very early phase of a stem cell transplant and that a bacterial infection was the \"primary cause of death\".\n\nThe review says that although disease progress was a major factor it judged that GNE bacterium was a \"significant factor\" in the cause of death. It says the infection was \"probably\" related to the hospital environment.\n\nA further child death was noted to have occurred within six weeks of an infection episode. The bacterium was said to be \"implicated\" in the death. It was recorded as possible contributory factor in the death certificate.\n\nThe review looked at 84 children and 118 episodes of infection.\n\nThe report was critical of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for not having a system in place that would have helped establish whether there was a link between bacteria in a patient and the place where they were treated.\n\nIn statement, Milly Main's mother, Kimberley Darroch said: \"There is nothing that can bring Milly back and a tiny part of me still hoped that the link to the water supply wasn't true.\n\n\"Finally we are starting to get answers after all these years.\"\n\nProf John Cuddihy, whose daughter Molly survived a rare infection in 2018, told the BBC there had been significant failings on the part of management and leadership within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\n\nHe said they had failed to adequately protect vulnerable children who were exposed to additional risk while undergoing treatment for cancers.\n\nProf Cuddihy said the report had been made possible \"due to the tenacity of families and those clinical staff who bravely exposed failings, at significant personal and professional cost\".\n\nHe said the report laid bare the impact of bacterial infection and the relationship with the environment at the hospital.\n\n\"This report identifies 84 cases and 118 episodes of bacterial infection- that's 84 critically ill, vulnerable children that have been exposed to significant additional risk, which has affected them physically, psychologically and emotionally,\" Prof Cuddihy said.\n\n\"Sadly, the report also highlights that two of those children who died did so, at least in part, as a result of their infection.\"",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "NHS executive Helen Bevan had her two Twitter accounts, with nearly 140,000 followers, stolen by hackers and used to promote fake PlayStation 5 sales.\n\nShe now has the accounts back but has received dozens of messages from people who fell for the scam.\n\nMs Bevan also paid money to someone who said they could help - but they turned out to be a scammer too.\n\nShe said she wanted to highlight the importance of extra security measures.\n\nNHS Horizons chief transformation officer Ms Bevan mistakenly thought she had activated two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires account-holders to use two methods to log in, the second often involving a code sent by text or email.\n\nHowever providing those contact details does not automatically activate 2FA, so the hackers were able to simply change the email address and phone number she had linked to the accounts once they had cracked her password.\n\nOne was a professional account with 97,000 followers discussing Ms Bevan's work, and the other one was about her cat, a local \"celebrity\", which was followed by 36,000 people. The hackers deleted all of her original tweets, unfollowed the people she was following, and renamed the accounts.\n\nIt happened the day before Ms Bevan was due to lead an online event for thousands of people, and she had encouraged her audience to use Twitter as their discussion tool.\n\nFacing this pressure, she felt panicked that her own account was not under her control.\n\n\"I was the social media heartbeat of this event, I didn't know what to do,\" she said.\n\n\"Someone said, 'You have a basic choice, you can wait for Twitter to give your account back or you can find someone to help you.'\"\n\nAs her friends and network were tweeting about the hack, offers of help flooded in and she chose someone who promised to have the accounts back within 25 minutes in return for a fee of \u00a3110.\n\n\"I don't think he did anything, he kept sending me films of computer files whirring, saying this is me doing your work,\" she said.\n\n\"Then he said he had got it back, but Twitter had changed the verification and he needed an extra $100, then he wanted a service charge\u2026 they prey on desperate people.\"\n\nShe did not pay anything further and accepts that the money she handed over is lost.\n\nAfter two days, Twitter itself restored the accounts for her.\n\nWhen she accessed them, she found dozens of direct messages from people asking about PlayStation 5 orders.\n\nShe says she has no idea how many fake sales were generated by the scammers but the PS5s were being advertised at upwards of $450 (\u00a3320).\n\n\"They were following Walmart, Dixons, PC World, Target,\" she said.\n\n\"They would wait for them to tweet about PS5s and then reply, saying we've got PS5s in stock now, DM [direct message] me.\"\n\nThere were also Fleets - temporary Twitter posts - featuring photos of PlayStation boxes.\n\nMs Bevan later had to explain to all who messaged her, having paid for games consoles, that she was also a victim of the scam.\n\nShe said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others.\n\n\"There are things I now know that I wish I'd known - everybody should have two-factor authentication, it's absolutely critical that you put that on,\" she said.\n\n\"Also, under no circumstances, even if you're desperate, do not go to one of these services that claim they'll get your account back in 30 minutes and stuff - I think they're likely to be a scammer.\n\n\"The only thing you can do is go through Twitter. Do it one step at a time.\"\n\nLisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, said having all the security settings enabled on all social media accounts is \"absolutely essential\".\n\n\"This means using a complex and long password, turning on two-factor authentication and, in the case of Twitter, enabling the password-reset protection setting,\" she said. \"Attackers are looking for easy targets. They have amazing eco-systems of businesses that allow them to take over your account, lock you out and then charge you to gain access back again.\"",

            "content": "Emma Homer said the attack had left her with \"anxiety, insomnia and stress\"\n\nA probationary police officer who assaulted a woman in a \"terrifying\" attack has been given a curfew, prompting criticism he was not jailed.\n\nWest Midlands Police PC Oliver Banfield grabbed and manhandled Emma Homer last July while drunk. He has been suspended and faces disciplinary action.\n\nThe investigating force has apologised for delays in the prosecution.\n\nLabour MP Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Must have been terrifying for her... but no prison sentence.\"\n\nMs Homer said the attack had left her with \"anxiety, insomnia and stress\" and her family said they were \"disappointed\" with 25-year-old Banfield's sentence, a night-time curfew.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing at Leicester Magistrates' Court, CCTV was shown in which Banfield could be seen shouting at Ms Homer.\n\nHe is seen grabbing her and forcing her to the floor during the assault in the early hours of 26 July in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire.\n\nIn her victim personal statement which was read out in court, she said she thought he was \"fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy\".\n\nDescribing the assault, Ms Homer, 37, said: \"I often ask myself if the impact of the attack would have been so severe if my assailant was not a police officer.\n\n\"During the assault as I struggled to get to safety, I was sure this drunk man was fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy.\n\n\"To be verbally abused with misogynistic slang, grabbed by the neck, and forced to the floor on a dark road by a drunk man a foot taller than me is terrifying, but to then find that he was a police officer shook my belief system to its core.\"\n\nShe said: \"I considered myself a confident, relaxed, and independent wife and mother, but since the attack I live with constant anxiety.\n\n\"I have changed simple things like my route home, and I have had to ask my family not to discuss the case as it sends me into a panic attack - indeed whenever the subject is brought up I feel a rush of anxiety and a tightening at my throat.\"\n\nWarwickshire Police said it had personally apologised to Ms Homer for delays in the investigation.\n\nInitially the CPS said there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution. But after Ms Homer appealed, further inquiries were made and Banfield was charged.\n\nWarwickshire's Chief Superintendent Ben Smith said the force recognised \"the strength of feeling that has come about as a result of Sarah Everard's tragic death and understand the concerns relating to violence against women and girls nationally\".\n\nAnd he added: \"We acknowledge that, due to internal process errors, the initial response to the report of the assault was not as swift as it should have been and an apology has been issued with regards to this.\"\n\nBanfield pleaded guilty to assault by beating at a hearing in January and at Friday's hearing received a 14-week curfew order banning him from leaving his house between 19:00 and 07:00. He was also ordered to pay his victim \u00a3500 compensation as well as a victim surcharge and court costs.\n\nMs Homer's family said a night-time curfew during lockdown was \"not really a punishment at all\".\n\nCriticising the non-custodial sentence in a tweet, Ms Harman wrote: \"He continues in post. WMPolice (West Midlands Police) must review.\n\n\"This is proof, if any needed, that system fails women and protects men.\"\n\nIn a statement, West Midlands Police said Banfield, of Bidford-on-Avon, had been suspended from duty and would now face charges of gross misconduct.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine said: \"Our role is to protect the public, who should be able to trust us. We therefore hold all our officers to the highest standards and we will take appropriate action against anyone whose actions fall below what is expected.\"\n\nThe West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said he had asked Chief Constable Sir David Thompson to brief him on steps taken by the force.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "description": "Boris Johnson will receive his first dose while European countries resume use of the Oxford vaccine.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The prime minister is to receive his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public it was \"safe\".\n\nBoris Johnson, 56, has urged people to get inoculated and said England's roadmap out of lockdown was \"on track\".\n\nHe said there was \"no change\" to the plan despite a drop in vaccine supply.\n\nSeveral European countries are to resume using the AstraZeneca jab after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\n\nThe regulator reviewed the vaccine amid fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with a higher risk and the benefits outweighed any risks.\n\nMr Johnson told a Downing Street conference on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but \"the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes\".\n\nThe prime minister was himself treated in hospital for Covid-19 in April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic.\n\n\"The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,\" he said.\n\nProf Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there were \"anecdotal reports\" of small numbers of people not turning up for vaccine appointments following the controversy over the AstraZeneca jab in Europe.\n\nBut he said he expected many of those would decide to get the jab after \"a pause for thought\", adding that Covid was still a \"very dangerous disease\".\n\n\"People dying, people getting significant blood clotting problems, that's one of the risks of Covid, people having long-term physical and mental effects from Covid,\" he said.\n\nMr Johnson said England's progress towards leaving restrictions on daily life was \"unchecked\" by vaccine supply issues, where fewer doses have arrived from India than initially expected.\n\nThere were often delays with vaccine rollout programmes, he said, and he stressed the Indian government had not stopped any exports.\n\nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said while the delay was \"disappointing\" he did not think it would have \"an enormous effect\" on the rollout.\n\nHowever, he warned the UK needed to keep variants of concern \"at bay\" until it could update vaccines and roll them out to the whole population.\n\nProf Ferguson, who is a member of the government's SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there should be particular concern about cases being imported from France, where infection levels are increasing.\n\nHe added that 5-10% of cases in France were the South African variant, which is of concern because it could be more resistant to current vaccines.\n\nBut Prof Ferguson suggested that adding France to the \"red list\" of countries, from which arrivals are required to quarantine in a hotel, would not be \"practical\" given the amount of essential trade between the UK and France.\n\nInstead he said \"a more bespoke arrangement\" to mitigate the risks, perhaps including testing of arrivals, would be needed.\n\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said rising infection rates in Europe should act as a \"wake-up call\" and the travel red list was kept under \"regular review\".\n\nThe European medical regulator had reviewed the AstraZeneca jab after 13 countries in Europe suspended its use over fears about blood clots in a very small number of patients.\n\nFrance, Germany and Italy, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, are to resume use of the jab on Friday while Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands will do so next week.\n\nBut Norway, Sweden and Denmark have said they will continue to pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine while they conduct their own independent reviews.\n\nLike his UK counterpart, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in an effort to sway a doubtful French public.\n\nSir Kent Woods, former chairman of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast the pause of the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab in some European countries was \"unfortunate\" because it could damage public confidence.\n\nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, said the EMA findings would help \"rebuild confidence\" and it was \"reassuring\" that safety monitoring was taking place.\n\nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also concluded that any link between the jab and clots was unproven.\n\nThe MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised but anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution.\n\nThe same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising.\n\nThat is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain.\n\nIt is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nIn the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal.\n\nThe EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety later on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK saw 7% more deaths than would be expected in 2020 based on the previous five years, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics covering up to mid-December.\n\nIt experienced one of the worst death rates in Europe in the first half of 2020 but has since been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.",

            "content": "Families seeking support for children with special educational needs face a \"postcode lottery\", a report suggests.\n\nChildren from the poorest areas are less likely to get help than those in more affluent areas, the Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank says.\n\nPupils have missed out on support due to remote learning and those in academy schools were less likely to be identified as needing support, it adds.\n\nThe Department for Education said the system needed to be more consistent.\n\nIt added that the government had increased funding to \u00a38bn in 2021-22.\n\nThe EPI study tracked the experiences of hundreds of thousands of pupils from a single year group through primary school.\n\nThe report it found \"deeply concerning\" inconsistencies in how children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in England have been identified and supported. More than a million children currently have special educational needs in England.\n\nChildren living in the most disadvantaged areas of the country were less likely to be formally recognised as having special needs than similar pupils in more affluent areas, researchers say. They said it highlighted how there was a \"rationing of support\" in many areas of need.\n\nMany of the most vulnerable children - such those who have suffered abuse or neglect or those frequently out of school - were less able to get support for more complex needs.\n\nThe report says the pandemic was likely to have exacerbated pre-existing problems with the system. With many children not in school and with growing delays, increasing numbers of vulnerable pupils were likely to have missed out on support.\n\n\"It is especially concerning that many of the most disadvantaged children with unstable home lives are less likely to access support for more complex learning needs\", said David Laws, executive chairman of the EPI.\n\n\"The government must drastically improve its efforts to ensure that it is reaching the most vulnerable children in society.\"\n\nPupils at academy schools - state-funded schools, which are independent from local authorities - are half as likely to be identified and given help than similar pupils in other schools, it said.\n\nFor children with more severe needs, those living in areas with very few academy schools are 10 times more likely to be identified with SEND by their local authority than similar children living in areas that have many academy schools.\n\nAcademy schools \"may be overlooking pupils who require SEND support\", the study said. But with limited data available, further research on SEND identification in academies was needed, it added.\n\nThe report contains a number of recommendations including more specialist training and support for teachers and a funding system that is far more responsive to pupils' needs.\n\nThe ASCL head teachers' union leader, Geoff Barton, urged caution before jumping to conclusions.\n\nHe said it was \"an extremely complex educational landscape\", adding: \"Everybody in the school system - in whatever type of school or area - is utterly committed to correctly identifying SEND and providing the support that children require.\n\n\"Schools have not been helped by the fact that government funding for this support has not matched the level of need, and that the SEND funding system is byzantine in its complexity.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Education said it had boosted high needs funding by nearly a quarter, to \u00a38bn in 2021-22.\n\n\"We know that despite the important reforms introduced to improve support for young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), the system is not working for every pupil - that's why our SEND Review is looking at how to make sure it is consistent all over the country, high quality, and integrated across education, health and care.\"",

I had been on set many times before, and I was able to talk her through what to expect - she was a bit star-struck when she saw the actors.\"\n\nLike most other shows, Coronation Street stopped filming during the first national lockdown in March 2020 and resumed filming in a restricted manner several months later.\n\nPorojnicu, who plays Alina, said the (non) kissing scene was a \"challenge\" but one she \"really enjoyed\".\n\nAlthough their characters look like they are sitting together, the actors were filmed having the conversation separately. The footage was composited together during post-production, giving the illusion they were next to each other.\n\nThe design department taped a pair of sunglasses onto a telescopic radio aerial to ensure the actors had the correct eye line, so they would appear to be looking into each other's eyes.\n\n\"It was difficult not being able to look into each other's eyes for the emotion of the scene but Coronation Street came up with a clever way to cheat that with sunglasses on an aerial,\" the actress said.\n\n\"Everything that's been said in the scene leads to the kiss which is very important for Alina because it is the first time that she has said out loud to Tyrone that she is falling for him.\"\n\nProducer Iain MacLeod praised the popular programme's writers, cast and crew for having \"cleverly worked around\" restrictions, for the best part of a difficult year.\n\nWhen the characters Debbie and Kevin were trapped in a fridge, the actors were tested for Covid beforehand and were placed in a bubble for the three days of filming, as were Alya, Yasmeen and Geoff for the dramatic rooftop scenes for the 60th anniversary show in December.\n\n\"We have therefore told the same stories throughout the pandemic that we would have told in 'normal' times,\" said MacLeod.\n\n\"But it just felt wrong to tell a story of an illicit liaison, where someone betrays their partner based on lust and sexual attraction, only for us not to see any of the chemistry and closeness.\n\n\"Hence the smoke and mirrors here.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "content": "There have been calls from tourism businesses for a firm reopening date\n\nA decision on whether Welsh tourism can reopen in time for Easter will not be made until \"the last moment\", the first minister has confirmed.\n\nSelf-contained holiday accommodation could reopen on 27 March if coronavirus case rates remain stable under Welsh government plans.\n\nTourism businesses have called for roadmap to allow them to prepare and for people to book trips.\n\nMr Drakeford said any confirmation would not be given until next week.\n\nSpeaking at the Welsh government's coronavirus briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said it was important \"to wait until the last moment you can\" before making and announcing decisions about easing lockdown, to see if case rates had changed.\n\n\"There are some parts of Wales where the position is not as good as we would like it to be,\" he said.\n\n\"People who follow the news will have seen overnight Paris has gone back into a lockdown again, so we've known all along how fast circumstances can change in coronavirus.\n\n\"That's why it's important to wait until the last moment you can in order to make these decisions because that way you have the best and latest data.\"\n\nSue Steadman started her business, Cadair View Lodge, in 2003 with her then husband.\n\nSue Steadman, who runs Cadair View Lodge in Snowdonia, said: \"Obviously it makes it more difficult. But we've had so much last-minute changes it's almost what we've come to expect.\"\n\n\"We've lost income, I haven't been paid since 2019 because everything I have has gone into running the business,\" she said.\n\n\"People need certainty. At the moment customers are debating whether or not to come thinking the pub won't be open, or the takeaway won't be available.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of regular guests who have all been very supportive. And they're looking forward to coming back,\" she said.\n\n\"The business has been running for 17 years, some of them have become like family. There have been first dates, proposals, and families brought to stay.\"\n\nHywel James Davies, who runs the South Wales Touring Park in Llanelli, said: \"I'm not sure that two days is enough time to prepare everything to open up but we'll cross our fingers and hope that everything will go to plan.\"\n\nSiblings Hywel and Cathrin run the site together on their farm\n\nMr Davies and his sister Cathrin have made the most of the lockdown by making improvements to the site for when customers come back.\n\n\"It's been very hard. But it's looking good this year, we're booked up,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to reopening to tell the truth. It's what we want, for people to come on their holidays and enjoy their stay with us.\"\n\nMr Drakeford also refused to rule out local lockdown restrictions in two hot spot areas in Wales, after a spike in cases.\n\nRates on Anglesey stand at 127.1 for every 100,000 people, and 147.5 in Merthyr Tydfil.\n\nThose higher levels of infection compare with an average falling rate for Wales of 43.7 per 100,000 people.\n\nMr Drakeford said the rise in cases in the communities was linked to \"household and social mixing\", and there were concerns people were not engaging with contact tracers.\n\nA Oxford-AstraZeneca shipment for Wales has been delayed by four weeks\n\nA delayed shipment from India to the UK could also impact the easing of lockdown, the first minister warned.\n\nAn estimated 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses due to arrive in Wales by mid-April are set to be delivered a month late.\n\nMr Drakeford said he could not pretend the delayed doses would \"have no affect at all\".\n\nFrom Monday garden centres will be allowed to reopen, and supermarkets to sell \"non-essential goods\", under slight easing of lockdown rules.\n\nMr Drakeford said he hoped more could be allowed - including outdoor children's activities and the reopening of castle grounds - in coming weeks if cases continued to fall.\n\n\"Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,\" he said.\n\n\"But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope.\"\n\nHe said he was confident that no vaccine appointments would be cancelled due to the delay, but that the loss of such a large amount of doses would have an effect.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated, there are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that,\" he said.\n\nReacting to the briefing, the Conservative group leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said it was \"unfair\" for supermarkets to be allowed to sell non-essential goods, and called for the high street to reopen.\n\n\"If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that?\" he said.\n\nMember of the Senedd for Ynys Mon Rhun ap Iorwerth said while he did not want to see his area placed under local lockdown again, the option was needed to stop case rates rising further.\n\nThe Plaid Cymru MS called for more support for people who were told to self-isolate in the area.",

            "section": "Wales",
            "content": "This year saw the highest ever uptake of the flu vaccine in over-65s\n\nA \"remarkable\" suppression of seasonal flu has seen only 18 cases recorded in Wales this winter, with no confirmed cases in the most recent week of data.\n\nThis compares with 1,657 recorded cases last winter, the largest year-on-year drop ever recorded.\n\nCatherine Moore of Public Health Wales said measures to slow the spread of Covid had led to levels of flu in winter she had never seen before.\n\nBut she said it could mean \"slightly more severe\" flu cases next winter.\n\nPublic Health Wales has said the flu virus is not currently circulating in Wales.\n\nCovid restrictions have been in place for most of the typical flu season, with strict limits on social contact in place.\n\nAcross a five-year average, flu has been the third-highest cause of death in Wales during winter months.\n\nHowever four out of the 11 leading causes of death are significantly lower than the five-year average.\n\nIn February 2021 flu and pneumonia were the ninth-highest causes of death, 73.2% lower than the five-year average.\n\nThe consultation rate for flu-like illnesses per 100,000 of the population hit a peak of 1.5 in early December.\n\nIn 2019-2020, that rate hit a high of just under 40 consultations per 100,000 over the Christmas period.\n\nLast winter, the level of flu circulating in Wales was seen as \"medium intensity\" - this winter has not even come close to meeting the threshold for \"low intensity\".\n\nConsultant virologist Dr Moore said: \"Any mitigation factor that we know reduces the transmission of a virus with a high transmissibility rate is likely to have a huge impact on a virus with a lower transmissibility rate.\n\n\"So people not moving around, people hand washing, all of the distancing, face cover wearing, all of that has a huge impact on viruses that perhaps don't transmit as well as the Sars-Cov-2 virus.\n\n\"The only time we see [figures this low] is in the summer months, when the virus is known not to be circulating.\n\n\"To see this level of suppression is remarkable, I've never seen something like this in my entire career working with influenza.\"\n\nDr Moore, who was appointed MBE for her work early on in the Covid-19 pandemic, said there were concerns the next flu season could be worse as a result of the lack of transmission this year.\n\nThis is because a large proportion of the population does not receive a flu jab, and the circulation of the most current strains of flu acts as a boost going into the next season.\n\n\"Immunisation is adding a boost for vulnerable groups, but a vast majority of workers don't have the immunisation, so we rely a little bit on that boosting effect to support them going into the next winter,\" she said.\n\n\"You will be boosted by the most current circulating virus, so if it's changed a little bit you'll have that boost to recognise the tiny changes which have happened in the virus during that year.\n\n\"We've completely missed a season, so the virus might have moved on a little further more than our immune system will remember.\n\n\"There is a potential there that we could being seeing slightly more severe flu than we would normally expect to see.\"\n\nThe flu vaccine uptake in Wales was the highest on record this year, with 76.5% of over-65s receiving the jab.\n\nLast year saw 69.4% of over-65s vaccinated, the highest number on record at the time.\n\nAn issue for medical professionals now is knowing what to include in the flu jab for next winter as, due to the lack of cases this winter, there is very little information on which strains have been circulating.\n\nNathan Sznerch, a GP in Wrexham, said Covid measures had made people more aware of hygiene measures and keeping a distance.\n\n\"We've certainly seen a reduction in the amount of people contacting us [for flu]. I think people are far more aware of the importance of hand hygiene, and wearing masks.\n\n\"All the measures we've utilised to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 have resulted in less flu transmission.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

Perhaps it's less fixed desks and more casual meeting areas, and we need to consider colleague wellbeing, too,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he emphasised that plans to sell Waterside were still at a very early stage. It is thought the airline has only recently hired property consultants to evaluate options.\n\nIn a separate statement to the BBC, BA said on Thursday: \"The global pandemic has shown us that many of our colleagues enjoy working remotely and want to continue, and this has accelerated our approach to offering more agile and flexible ways of working.\n\n\"Our aim is to find a hybrid working model that suits our business, blending the best of office and remote working for our people. We've also re-structured our business to emerge from the crisis and are considering whether we still have the need for such a large headquarters building.\"\n\nThe move to hybrid working after the pandemic is growing.\n\nThe Nationwide building society has indicated that it does not intend to force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic.\n\nOil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\n\nAnd banks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements.\n\nEarlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working \"to become the norm\" for many companies.\n\nMark Dixon said: \"It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper. It's also much, much better for the environment.\"",

The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to.\n\nAlex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018.\n\nNicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough.\n\nHer testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private.\n\nThe opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account.\n\nWith the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign.\n\n\"I have said for weeks that evidence against Nicola Sturgeon has been mounting, it has been growing and it is clear she has breached the ministerial code.\n\n\"You cannot continue as first minister of Scotland if you have misled Parliament and breached the ministerial code.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it would be \"incredibly serious\" if the committee concluded that the first minister had misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code.\n\nHe added: \"This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life.\"",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "Covid deaths: Why is the UK's death toll so bad?\n\nMore than 100,000 people in the UK have died from a virus, that, this time last year, felt like a far-off foreign threat. How did we come to be one of the countries with the worst death tolls?\n\nThere is no quick answer to that question, and there is sure to be a long and detailed public inquiry once the pandemic is over. But there are plenty of clues that, when pieced together, help build a picture of why the UK has reached this devastating number.\n\nSome will point a finger at the government - its decision to lock-down later than much of western Europe, the stuttering start to its test-and-trace network and the lack of protection afforded to care home residents.\n\nOthers will spotlight deeper rooted problems with British society - its poor state of public health, with high levels of obesity, for example.\n\nOthers, still, will note that some of the UK's great strengths - its position as a vibrant hub for international air travel, its ethnically diverse and densely-packed urban populations - exposed its vulnerability to a virus that spreads effortlessly between people.\n\nIn some people's eyes, the UK's island status might have helped it. New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan managed to stop the virus getting a foothold and deaths have been kept to a minimum - Australia has seen fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than the UK is recording every day on average.\n\nAll introduced strict border restrictions immediately and lockdowns to contain the virus before it had spread. The UK did not. It was not until June that quarantine rules were introduced for all arrivals and even then travel corridors were soon set up, relaxing the rules for travellers from certain countries. Only this month were these scrapped.\n\nProf Devi Sridhar, an expert in public health from Edinburgh University, is one of those who has been critical of the approach the UK has taken from the start.\n\nShe says the UK, like much of Europe, was \"complacent\" about the threat of infectious disease - choosing to treat the new coronavirus \"like flu\" and allowing it to spread, while talking about the desire to achieve herd immunity.\n\nThis all changed in late March, when a full lockdown eventually came. But there was a crucial delay of a week which is estimated to have cost more than 20,000 lives, according to government modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, because of how quickly infection rates were doubling at that point.\n\nThis, of course, is said with the benefit of hindsight. Government modellers themselves acknowledge the data was \"really quite poor\" making it difficult to make a decision that would have significant repercussions. It is a point acknowledged by Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser. Speaking in the summer he said there had been \"very limited information\" in early March.\n\nBy then, the virus was ripping through care homes. Around 30% of deaths in the first wave happened in care homes; 40% if you include care home residents who died in hospital.\n\nThose at the heart of government acknowledge mistakes were made. UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said recently: \"The lesson is go earlier than you think you want to, go harder than you think you want to, and go a bit broader than you think you want to in terms of applying the restrictions.\"\n\nBy May, restrictions were beginning to be eased. But was this too soon?\n\nThe government seized on the relative lull to focus on building what the prime minister promised would be a \"world-beating\" test-and-trace system. The idea was that new outbreaks could be nipped in the bud, with comprehensive tracking by a centralised team of tracers.\n\nThe mere fact this had to be done some months after the virus had struck, illustrates another factor behind the high number of deaths - the UK was simply not prepared for a pandemic of this nature in the way some Asian nations had been. Countries such as South Korea and Taiwan had established test-and-trace systems in place that were ready to be activated.\n\nThe UK had a chance to bed in its system in the summer but it was riven with teething problems, with tracers struggling to reach many contacts and the testing capacity slowing down as demand rose.\n\nLow levels of infection over the summer had created a false sense of security.\n\nDesperate to boost the economy, the government launched the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, offering people discounted meals out during August. To what extent it contributed to the rise in the autumn is much argued about but certainly some doctors blame it in part for an increase in patients seen.\n\nThe truth is the virus never went away. Testing in the summer showed even at the lowest levels there were still around 500 cases a day being diagnosed - and random testing in the population subsequently showed the true level may have been twice that.\n\nIn late August around 1,000 people a day were testing positive. By mid-September that had trebled and from there it rose five-fold to 15,000 by mid October. The numbers testing positive have never returned below 10,000 a day on average since.\n\nAnother decision that has been heavily criticised was the refusal of ministers to introduce a short two-week lockdown, or \"circuit breaker\", in September - despite their advisers on Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommending such a step. The argument was it would have set the spread of the virus back by at least a month, giving test and trace time to regroup.\n\nWales, however, did introduce its own \"fire-breaker\" - a 17-day lockdown in October. It got infection rates down, but as soon as it was lifted they rebounded. This is, of course, why lockdowns have been criticised.\n\nEdinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, one of the modellers who feeds data into Sage, is on the record in the autumn questioning the logic of them for this very reason. It remains up for debate how effective a circuit-breaker would actually have been.\n\nThis after all is the time of year when respiratory illnesses start to increase. Schools had returned as had university students, creating new environments for the novel coronavirus to spread.\n\nWhen a lockdown was eventually introduced in England in November it was to last four weeks, with Sage members lamenting the delay. \"The absence of a decision is a decision in itself,\" says Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar.\n\nBut even before that lockdown was lifted cases had started going up in the south-east of England. Within weeks it became clear what was happening. The virus had mutated and a new faster-spreading variant was on the rise.\n\nBy mid-December the clamour for lockdown was growing again, but the plan for a Christmas relaxation of restrictions had already been announced. In every nation of the UK, ministers waited.\n\nAt the start of 2021, with hospital admissions rising rapidly, the UK's four chief medical officers intervened, issuing a joint statement warning the NHS was at \"material risk\" of being overwhelmed. Within hours the UK was back in lockdown.\n\nWhat has struck some is just how similar the mistakes have been in terms of locking down late.\n\n\"It will take years to unpick why Covid has gone so badly in the UK,\" says University College London infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone. \"But the failure to learn from wave one stands out.\"\n\nBut it must also be recognised that there are factors outside the control of the government - certainly in terms of its pandemic response - that have contributed to the high number of deaths.\n\nOne of the reasons the virus was able to take a hold and spread so quickly was because of geography and the fact the UK - and London in particular - is a global hub. Genetic analysis has shown the virus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, mainly from France, Spain and Italy, by the end of March.\n\nIt was here before we knew it. That's not something Australia or New Zealand had to deal with on such a scale.\n\nDensity of population is also a factor. The UK is among the 10 most densely populated big nations - those with populations of more than 20 million. What is more, our cities are more inter-connected than they are in many places.\n\nIt meant the virus was able to seed everywhere quite quickly. Contrast this with Italy which saw the vast majority of cases in the north of the country in the first wave.\n\nThe ageing population also needs to be taken into account. Once you do this, and adjust for the size of the population - known as age-standardised mortality - deaths have risen, but not by as much as some of the headline figures suggest.\n\nThe health of the nation has also been a factor. The UK has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. And obesity increases the risk of hospitalisation and death, according to Public Health England. One study found the risk of death was almost double for those who are severely obese.\n\nConditions such as diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems also increase the risk - a fifth of Covid deaths have listed diabetes on the death certificate.\n\nAgain the UK has relatively high rates of these illnesses.\n\nBut many have argued that these high levels of ill-health have been compounded by the levels of inequality in the UK.\n\nLevels of ill health and life expectancy have always been worst in the poorest areas, but the pandemic certainly seems to have exacerbated this.\n\nOffice for National Statistics data shows mortality rates have been twice as high in deprived areas as they have been in wealthy areas. The Health Foundation is carrying out its own inquiry into the issue, arguing the Covid death toll needs to be seen through the \"lens\" of inequality to fully understand it.\n\nIt is something that has also been raised by Prof Michael Marmot, one of the country's leading experts on health inequalities. \"The UK's dismal record is telling us something important about our society.\"\n\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by bereavement, here is a list of organisations that may be able to help.",

People shouldn't feel sorry for me but I have changed. I've been punished enough.\"\n\nIPPs were designed for the most violent and sexual offenders.\n\nBack in 2005, the Labour government thought they'd be used for around 900 offenders - but 6,000 people received the sentence.\n\nMany were kept in jail for years after their tariff expired.\n\nThe prison and parole system couldn't cope with the need to give inmates access to rehabilitation programmes in order to demonstrate they were safe to be let out.\n\nAccording to official probation documents, Maroni had a difficult childhood.\n\nHis mum was an alcoholic and drug user and her partner used to beat her and Maroni.\n\nHe missed three years of school and attempted to take his own life using his mother's drugs.\n\nSince he's been in custody, his mental health has deteriorated significantly - exacerbated, he says, by having a sentence which gave him no hope.\n\nHe's self-harmed, had panic attacks and says he's been diagnosed with a personality disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nHis application for parole has been rejected several times because the parole board thought he still posed a risk to the public.\n\nHe's due to have another hearing this summer and is feeling optimistic.\n\nSir David Lidington and Lord Clarke say setting a firm release date for IPP inmates would bring their treatment in line with prisoners on determinate sentences of a fixed length, but warn it could also mean \"letting out people who were still considered dangerous\".\n\nLord Blunkett, who as Labour home secretary introduced IPPs back in 2005, has expressed regret before about the way they were used for many more people than he intended or expected.\n\nHe has now told the World at One the fact there are still 1,900 people in jail on an IPPs \"weighs heavily on him\".\n\nFamilies want all those on IPPs with a minimum tariff of under five years - like Maroni - to have their cases reviewed and given a sentence with an end date.\n\nOnly then, they say, will the legacy of these \"disgraceful\" sentences end.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said in a statement: \"The number of IPP prisoners has fallen by two-thirds since 2012 - and is down 13% in the last year.\n\n\"We are helping those still in custody progress towards release, but as a judge deemed them to be a high risk to the public, the independent Parole Board must decide if they are safe to leave prison.\"\n\u2022 None Man 'trapped' in jail term to be released",

View original tweet on Twitter\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Steve Aiken, said the \"controversial\" issue of abortion should be dealt with by the whole executive.\n\n\"Any unilateral decision by the health minister to commission and fund new abortion services without executive approval would be a breach of the Northern Ireland Act and the Ministerial Code,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it was \"deeply regrettable that some political parties are seeking to score points on such a sensitive issue\".\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a \"matter of regret\" the executive had not been able to \"commission services in line with its legal obligations\".\n\n\"The SDLP has been warning for weeks that this British government has shown no restraint when it comes to interfering with the devolution settlement,\" he said.\n\nMs Hargey said it was \"unfortunate and unnecessary\" that the action was not able to be taken locally.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said the \"executive as a whole, and certainly those parties who are blocking the commissioning of these services, need to be implementing them as soon as possible\".\n\nShe said she had unsuccessfully tried to have the issue placed on the agenda for the executive last week, and would try again for next week.\n\nThe Church of Ireland said the move was \"unjustified\" now Stormont was sitting again.\n\nArchbishop of Armagh John McDowell said it was \"clearly a devolved matter\".\n\nThe Presbyterian Church said it would \"seriously undermine\" devolution and called on Mr Lewis to withdraw the proposal.\n\nAt present health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\n\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\n\nIt passed its second reading on Monday with the support of a number of parties.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\n\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members.",

            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "The French capital is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as the country fears a third wave.\n\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France will be placed under the measures from midnight on Friday.\n\nThese measures will not be as strict as the previous lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, with people allowed to exercise outdoors.\n\nFrance has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours.\n\nMr Castex said a \"third wave\" of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely.\n\nThe situation in Paris is particularly worrying with 1,200 people in intensive care there, more than at the peak of the second wave in November, Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said.\n\nUnder the new measures, non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but schools will remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a \"particular sanitary protocol\".\n\nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Attal stressed there would be differences with the two earlier lockdowns and said further details would be given of which business could stay open or would have to shut.\n\nPeople will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home and are not allowed to travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. Those in the affected areas will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes.\n\nThere is a weary resignation about Paris, as people prepare for another four weeks of tedium. Yes, we know this third lockdown won't be quite as bad as the second - which was itself a lighter version of the first. But still.\n\nAnother month of bits of paper for the police; another month of having to justify a trip to the supermarket; another month without meaningful social contact. It's enough to drive you to distraction.\n\nFrance's SNCF train company reported a surge in bookings ahead of the new lockdown\n\nExcept it hasn't. In general, most Parisians simply knuckle under. Those who can are leaving by train or car, but because schools are staying open, most families will stick it out in the city.\n\nEveryone's made the calculation. The long Easter weekend in two weeks is a bust. But the Paris school holidays start on 17 April - exactly when the lockdown is supposed to end.\n\nThat's the light that will keep people going. Spring break.\n\nAs well as the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France, Seine-Maritime and Eure areas will go under lockdown as well as the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera.\n\nFrance's nationwide curfew will remain in place. However, it will begin an hour later at 19:00 (18:00 GMT), taking into account the longer hours of daylight.\n\nFears of a third wave come as the French government faces criticism for its slow vaccine rollout.\n\nFrom Friday, France will resume vaccinating using the AstraZeneca jab following the EMA's announcement that it was fit for use. Mr Castex said he would be getting the vaccine straight away to prove that it was OK.\n\nFrance had suspended the jab after a number of people in Europe reported blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered.\n\nA survey conducted just as the suspension was announced found that only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca.",

There is no question that Nicola Sturgeon has misled parliament and broken the promises she made to tell the truth.\n\n\"The SNP's erratic outburst today against the committee shows the panicked spiral they are now in.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would not \"prejudge\" the outcome of the report\n\nBut he said that if the report found the first minister had misled parliament, and potentially broken the ministerial code, then it would be \"incredibly serious\".\n\n\"The code itself is clear, if the code has been breached the individual should resign,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the process had \"turned into a complete farce\", with \"party politics over-riding the public interest\".\n\nWithin a week, Holyrood will be on a break for the election and a six-week campaign for votes will be under way.\n\nWe know there will be arguments over coronavirus recovery and indyref2, but there will also be another major theme: truth and trust.\n\nThat debate will feed off the two reports due in the next few days on the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond.\n\nWhen the Holyrood committee publishes its findings on Tuesday, we know the opposition majority will conclude that Nicola Sturgeon gave them a misleading account, which the first minister denies.\n\nA separate independent investigation by Ireland's former prosecution chief, James Hamilton, will decide whether or not the first minister broke conduct rules and recommend sanctions, if required.\n\nThe Conservatives have already decided Ms Sturgeon lied to parliament and should resign, and they intend to hold a vote of no confidence in her on Wednesday if she does not quit.\n\nWith the continued support of the Scottish Greens, the first minister can survive what she regards as a nakedly political attempt to oust her and let the public decide whether she should remain in office.\n\nThere has never been a Holyrood election campaign curtain-raiser anything like this.\n\nThe committee's convener, SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, expressed her anger that \"accounts of the conclusions of the draft report\" had been leaked to the media.\n\n\"I am dismayed by the damage this may do to the value of the committee's work, which I have long hoped would improve the treatment of the complainers of sexual harassment,\" she said.\n\n\"The selective leaking of particular committee recommendations has shifted the focus away from these goals, and the recommendations which seek to achieve it, and onto party political terrain which will likely frustrate, not assist, the women at the heart of this.\"\n\nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants.\n\nThe former first minister was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following a judicial review, and was subsequently acquitted of sexual assault charges in a High Court trial.\n\nA separate inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code is being carried out by James Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer. He is also expected to publish his report in the coming days.",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "The government has announced the first stages of its plans to get ultra-fast broadband to the remotest of homes in the UK.\n\nOriginally it had promised to roll out gigabit-speed broadband to every home in Britain by 2025 but that was reduced to 85% coverage in November.\n\nThe budget remains at \u00a35bn - but only \u00a31.2bn of that will be made available up to 2024.\n\nThe infrastructure build should start in 2022, the government said.\n\nThe first to benefit will be homes and businesses in Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Durham, Essex, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Tees Valley.\n\nThe next areas are expected to be Norfolk, Shropshire, Suffolk, Worcestershire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.\n\nA former voucher scheme is also being relaunched to provide more immediate help to those struggling with poor broadband coverage, with up to \u00a3210m being made available.\n\nIt is expected that commercial deployments of gigabit-capable fibre networks will reach more than 70% of premises by the end of 2025, without government intervention.\n\nThe government has said that reaching the final 1% of homes in very remote areas could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described Project Gigabit as \"the rocket boost that we need to get lightning-fast broadband to all areas of the country\".\n\nThe trade organisation techUK has also welcomed the news.\n\nAnd speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden said: \"We've already made tremendous progress with Project Gigabit - our national mission to get everyone in the country the fastest broadband on the planet.\n\n\"We've gone from around 9% coverage in 2019 to 40% now - I'm confident we'll get to 60% by the end of the year.\n\n\"The challenge is the last 20%, which can't be delivered commercially - and that's what our plans being outlined today are all about.\"\n\nHe reiterated the watered-down plans to reach \"at least 85% of the country by 2025\".\n\n\"I think we will be able to go faster than that still - and the prime minister and I are meeting with telecoms companies again.\n\n\"Basically, we have the money to provide that subsidy, it's about the capacity in the telecoms market to deliver it, because remember these are very remote areas.\n\nYesterday BT said it would \"build like fury\" to roll out full-fibre internet connections, following new rules announced by the UK's telecoms regulator Ofcom.\n\nThe major broadband networks have been pressing the government to make clear how it planned to allocate the public money it's set aside for Project Gigabit, so they'll be relieved to get some detail.\n\nBut it's still clear that the plan to put rural Britain in the broadband fast lane is behind schedule.\n\nAt the 2019 election, the manifesto promise was to give every home and business a Gigabit connection by the end of 2025. Last November that target was cut to 85% of premises, with just \u00a31.2bn available in the short term.\n\nNow that money is beginning to flow, but with Openreach's chief executive emphasising the need for speedy decisions, it seems there's not complete confidence that even the more limited target will be hit.\n\nThe issue was a key manifesto commitment for the Conservatives at the last general election, when they promised to \"bring full fibre and gigabit capable broadband to every home and business across the UK by 2025\".\n\nThe subject is the topic of frequent questions by Conservative MPs at PMQs - highlighting how much of an important issue it is for them and their constituents.\n\nBBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says that having promised to 'level up' and increase opportunity for parts of the UK previously left behind and under-funded, this policy is seen as a key part of that agenda for the government.",

It was very good, very quick - I cannot recommend it too highly.\n\n\"Everybody, when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else.\"\n\nMore than 26 million people have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, according to the latest government figures. About two million people have had a second dose.\n\nIn England, 22,337,590 people had been given a first jab as of 18 March, according to NHS England, the equivalent of 50.5% of the population aged 18 and over.\n\nVaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi also received his vaccination at a pharmacy in Lewisham, south-east London, earlier.\n\nMeanwhile countries including France, Germany and Italy began restarting their vaccine programmes with the AstraZeneca jab - reversing earlier decisions to suspend them over blood clot concerns.\n\nThe resumption of the use of the vaccine comes after the European Medicines Agency confirmed it was \"safe and effective\".\n\nThe regulator reviewed the jab over fears about blood clots, but said it was \"not associated\" with a higher risk of such events, and that the benefits outweighed any risks.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency have said the jab is safe and have encouraged people to take up their vaccine appointments.\n\nThe WHO's advisory committee on vaccine safety issued a statement on Friday saying the vaccine \"continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world\".\n\nOn Thursday, the prime minister reiterated that the jab was safe and urged people to take the vaccine if they were offered it.\n\nHe said: \"The thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it's so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes.\"\n\nHe also insisted that delays to the UK's Covid vaccine supply in April would not affect people getting their second doses, or England's road map out of lockdown.\n\n\"The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,\" he said.\n\nIn other developments, ONS figures suggest infection levels have continued to fall across England and Wales but have \"levelled off\" in Northern Ireland and increased in Scotland.\n\nAn estimated one in 335 people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week to 13 March, according to the figures, down from one in 280 last week.\n\nOn Friday, the UK reported a further 101 deaths and 4,802 cases, according to the government's separate daily coronavirus figures.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Government borrowing levels continued to set new records last month, reflecting the cost of supporting the UK's economy during the pandemic.\n\nThe government borrowed \u00a319.1bn in February, the highest figure for that month since records began in 1993.\n\nMeasures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard.\n\nHowever, February's borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast.\n\nBorrowing for the financial year to date - between April and February - has now reached \u00a3278.8bn, the Office for National Statistics said, a record for that period.\n\nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: \"Coronavirus has caused one of the largest economic shocks this country has ever faced, which is why we responded with our \u00a3352bn package of support to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\n\"This was the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support the public finances in the medium term.\"\n\nChristine Jardine, Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said that while the latest figures showed scale of the challenge posed by the pandemic, \"they can not be used as an excuse by the government to end support prematurely, and leave behind people and businesses struggling across the UK\".\n\n\"Thousands of small businesses are due to stay closed for months to come, and millions of people are still worried about their jobs. Yet the chancellor failed to provide them with long-term certainty and direct support in the Budget.\"\n\nThe latest ONS figures showed the government spent \u00a33.9bn last month on job support measures alone.\n\nThey also revealed a fall in tax income, notably from lower VAT, business rates and fuel duty, although they also showed money coming in from self-employed tax payments rose by \u00a3900m from last year.\n\nTotal public sector debt has risen to \u00a32.13 trillion, according to the ONS. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK's economy, with debt having reached 97.5% of annual economic output.\n\nDebt levels as high as this have not been seen since the early 1960s.\n\nUltimately, if it's consistently spending much more than it has in the past, the state has to raise more money in taxes. But the key word there is \"ultimately\". There is no urgency to repaying the government's debt. More urgent are the debts of small businesses and poorer households.\n\nOrdinary households rightly fear getting into too much debt because if interest rates rise, lenders can close in and deploy lawyers and bailiffs with all the attendant unpleasantness.\n\nBut it is profoundly wrong and misleading to infer that it's like that for governments who issue their own sovereign currency.\n\nUnlike households, governments controlling their own currency can borrow without limit money that they have freshly created.\n\nThey therefore can't go bankrupt. Because almost all of the money borrowed by the government in this financial year (by issuing gilts) will be owed to another public sector body, the Bank of England, it's nothing like a household borrowing from a bank.\n\nAnd in fact, as the government tacitly acknowledged in its recent Budget, it makes sense in the midst of an economic contraction for the government to spend more, not less - not least because other parts of the economy (households and businesses) aren't spending anything like what they normally would.\n\nWithout the additional government spending the economic contraction would, without a shadow of a doubt, be worse.\n\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that despite the high level of borrowing, the government's increased spending was the only sensible course at this time.\n\n\"Today's figures are pretty terrible but it is important to take in to account the economy as well. The chancellor is doing the right thing in continuing to support the economy,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\n\"His action in the Budget to extend many of the existing schemes means the rug will not pulled out from under the feet of households and businesses.\n\n\"If we can limit the damage to the economy now, when the crisis ends it means the country will be stronger amore able to cope with that debt.\"\n\nSeparately, the government said it would receive \u00a31.1bn from selling part of its stake in NatWest Group.\n\nThe sale will cut the size of the government's stake in the bank - which was previously called Royal Bank of Scotland - from almost 62% to 59.8%.\n\nThe government bought shares in the bank to help keep it afloat during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe value of those shares has since fallen, meaning the government has made an overall loss of \u00a31.84bn excluding dividend payments.\n\nThe Treasury said \"its ambition is to return the bank to private ownership once the original goal of preserving financial stability has been achieved\".",

            "content": "Health Minister Robin Swann says every adult in Northern Ireland will still get their first vaccine dose by the end of July.\n\nIt follows an expected reduction in the UK's Covid-19 vaccine supply.\n\nThat is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\n\nMr Swann said officials were doing all they could to ensure any delays to the department's timeline were shortened as much as possible.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Newsline, Mr Swann said he did not expect any changes to the lifting of Northern Ireland's coronavirus restrictions in light of the vaccine supply.\n\n\"We don't put dates to anything and I think it's exactly these sorts of unforeseen circumstances that allow us to take that approach,\" he said.\n\n\"The announcements made on Tuesday in regards to the next phase of lifting restrictions won't be affected by the delay of this supply of vaccine.\n\n\"I don't think this delay should have an effect on what the executive wants to do in easing further restrictions.\"\n\nA paper from the Department of Health shows that the R number in Northern Ireland is currently at between 0.9-1.10.\n\nThe minister said it showed the rate of infection was still decreasing, which meant the executive had been allowed to progress with making some changes to the lockdown regulations.\n\n\"One of the things we've always been aware of is keeping R below one... considering where we were back in mid-December, early January we are still moving in the right direction,\" he added.\n\n\"That comes about by the observance of restrictions and regulations but also by greater uptake of the vaccine as well and when we look to the hope that the vaccine brings that will allow us to come out of an incredibly dark time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme told the Stormont Assembly more Pfizer doses would be used until extra AstraZeneca jabs arrive.\n\nShe said anyone expecting a second dose or who had already booked their first would have their appointments honoured.\n\nFirst jabs would continue in April, if at a slightly reduced rate, she added.\n\nOn Thursday, another Covid-19-related death and 169 new cases of the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland.\n\nThere were no coronavirus-related deaths reported in the Irish Republic on Thursday.\n\nHowever, there were 582 confirmed new cases of the virus in the country.\n\nVaccine delivery issues could put the rollout plan back by four weeks in a \"worst-case scenario\", Ms Donnelly told Stormont's Health Committee, but the delay was more likely to be about two weeks.\n\n\"The mitigation measures that we put in place we hope will only delay us by two weeks, so it won't have a huge impact,\" she said.\n\nIt had been hoped vaccinations would be on offer to all people over the age of 40 when a mass vaccination centre at Belfast's SSE Arena opened on 29 March, but this would likely be delayed by two weeks, said Ms Donnelly.\n\n\"It will very much depend on the remaining deliveries that we get from AstraZeneca,\" she said.\n\n\"We have tried to find some mitigation through further use of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nMs Donnelly said three of Northern Ireland's five health trusts would now rely mainly on Pfizer doses until more AstraZeneca supplies arrived.\n\nOn Wednesday, NHS England warned there could be a \"significant reduction\" in the number of doses available in April.\n\nEarlier, Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout was ahead of schedule and would be able to adapt.\n\nNews of the UK vaccine shortage was frustrating, if not surprising, said the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"The pace of vaccination has depended on the supply from the outset,\" tweeted Dr Alan Stout.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating but perhaps not surprising.\n\nThe pace of vaccination has depended on the supply from the outset.\n\nIt highlights the importance of the plan to date in that we have the vast majority of those most at risk already with first dose. https://t.co/hhpOgghOoi \u2014 Alan Stout (@AlanStout19) March 18, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter\n\n\"We've done so well, so far, that the vast majority of those people who are at risk have now had their first dose,\" He told The Nolan Show.\n\n\"If it does mean that the consequences of delaying a first dose to someone we know who is at less risk, then that's going to have to be a decision that's made to protect those second doses.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland was still on course to meet its target of having most adults vaccinated by June or July, said Justice Minister Naomi Long.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 300 pharmacies have signed up to be part of the vaccination scheme.\n\nOfficial launch of the rollout will begin on 30 March, although some pharmacies may start before then.\n\n\"Their contribution to getting as many people vaccinated as possible will be invaluable,\" said Mr Swann.\n\nThe chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said. \"The accessibility and reach of the community pharmacy network, with pharmacists as skilled vaccinators, means they are well equipped to take part in the vaccine programme.\"\n\nMr Greene called their inclusion in the programme \"a fantastic and welcome step forward\" and said that this will not affect other pharmacy services.\n\nCommunity pharmacies were used to having to deal with supply issues, he said, adding that the anticipated drop in vaccine supply was unlikely to undermine Northern Ireland's programme.",

            "section": "Northern Ireland",
            "content": "Abortion: UK government to compel Stormont to implement new laws\n\nThe UK government is to make an unprecedented move to give the Northern Ireland secretary new powers to compel Stormont to implement abortion laws.\n\nNorthern Ireland's abortion laws changed last March after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution.\n\nBut the commissioning of full services has been stalled due to differences within the five-party executive.\n\nStormont and Westminster are facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over the delay.\n\nThis latest development, first reported by the Guardian, will see Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis lay new regulations in Parliament early next week.\n\nThe move will let him direct Northern Ireland's Department of Health to commission the services.\n\nA Whitehall source said there was frustration and disappointment at the failure of the Northern Ireland Executive to act.\n\n\"It has not commissioned abortion services consistent with the regulations originally set out by the UK government nearly a year ago,\" the source said.\n\nThey added Mr Lewis was clear that the devolution settlement should not be a barrier.\n\nHowever, the move is likely to draw criticism from some of the Stormont parties.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster and one of the party's MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson met the Northern Ireland secretary on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Sir Jeffrey said the government's move would \"raise serious questions about when and in what areas [it] can make interventions in a devolved administration\".\n\nHe said the DUP would \"vigorously oppose such steps\" and warned that the government \"should leave it with the devolved structures to make such decisions\".\n\nLate on Thursday night, Northern Ireland's Department of Health said Mr Swann's position was that the issue of abortion services was controversial and required the support of the whole executive.\n\n\"He does not believe that a ministerial decision to commission and fund abortion services would be defensible in court in the absence of executive approval,\" it added.\n\nThe timing of this move by Brandon Lewis is far from coincidental.\n\nIt's almost a year exactly since the UK government introduced the abortion laws that were supported by Westminster MPs but opposed by a number of Northern Ireland parties who accused No 10 of trampling over devolution.\n\nThe government remains bound by law to ensure the services are implemented and it's understood frustration was mounting behind the scenes at the slow pace within Stormont.\n\nThere is also an incoming legal challenge which may have focused minds in London.\n\nThis development will certainly turn up the political heat but it won't lead to imminent change as Mr Lewis will likely take the powers and wait to see how the executive reacts before deciding to go further.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Emma Sheerin called on the health minister to \"fulfil his legal obligations and responsibilities\" by commissioning abortion services.\n\nAlliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said it was \"bewildering\" that legislation approved last year had not been put into effect.\n\n\"The requirement in law and in treaty is for women in Northern Ireland to have the same access to health services as in the rest of the UK,\" she said.\n\n\"There is no excuse for any minister, either though action or inaction, to stand in the way of that.\"\n\nThe law changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\n\nA change to the law last year allows abortions in the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy\n\nHowever, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is challenging the UK government, the Stormont executive and the Department of Health for delaying the commissioning of services.\n\nAt present health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\n\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\n\nIt passed its second reading on Monday with the support of a number of parties.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\n\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members.",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "Nasa has carried out a successful test on part of the most powerful rocket in existence - the Space Launch System (SLS).\n\nEngines on the rocket's \"core stage\" were kept running for more than eight minutes - simulating the time it takes the SLS to go from the ground to space.\n\nIt's the second such test for the biggest segment of the SLS, after an attempt in January shut down early.\n\nThe SLS is to send humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972.\n\nThe mission is part of Nasa's Artemis project, launched by the Trump administration in 2017.\n\nThe launcher consists of the orange core, with its four powerful RS-25 engines, and two boosters attached to the sides.\n\nThe test at Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis, Mississippi, began at 16:37 ET (20:37 GMT). The core was attached to a giant structure called the B-2 test stand.\n\nA massive plume of exhaust expanded from the stand as the engines shook the ground. The cloud was so enormous, it was spotted from space by the Goes-16 satellite.\n\nAlthough the target was to fire the engines for eight minutes, teams from Nasa and prime contractor Boeing only had to keep them on for 250 seconds (four minutes) in order to gather all the engineering data they needed.\n\n\"It was a great day and a great test,\" said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk.\n\nThe chair of the US House Committee on Science, Space and Technology congratulated Nasa on the successful test. Texas democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson said: \"Achieving this significant milestone is a story of tenacity and dedication.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today's successful test brings us one step closer to returning American astronauts to the Moon in preparation for the human exploration of Mars.\"\n\nThe core that was part of Thursday's test will be used for the maiden flight of the SLS - currently scheduled for late 2021.\n\nIn the 1960s, the stand tested engines used in the massive Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo astronauts to the Moon.\n\nJohn Shannon, Boeing's vice president and program manager for the SLS, told me before the first hotfire attempt: \"When the engines start and then throttle up, we will do what's called a gimbal profile at 60 seconds. The engine nozzles move in a pre-programmed set of movements.\"\n\nThis gimbal movement of the nozzles allows the rocket to be steered during flight.\n\n\"This is the most heavily instrumented vehicle we will ever fly so we will get a tremendous amount of engineering data on vibration and temperature and stress, acoustics,\" said Mr Shannon.\n\nBefore Thursday's hotfire, engineers filled the core stage with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of propellant.\n\nThat propellant consisted of liquid hydrogen, which is the rocket's fuel, and liquid oxygen, which helps the fuel burn. They react explosively inside the engines, generating super-heated water vapour from the exhaust.\n\nWhen they're fed to the engines, the propellants are at more than two hundred degrees below zero (F), but the exhaust that emerges is 6,000F (3,316C) - hot enough to boil iron.\n\nHundreds of thousands of gallons of water were directed into the flame bucket to cool the exhaust. In addition, tens of thousands of gallons were used to create a water \"curtain\" around the engines to suppress the noise generated when they fire for eight minutes.\n\nThis was done to protect the core stage from vibrations while it is anchored to the stand.\n\nThe RS-25s, built by California-based Aerojet Rocketdyne, are the same ones that powered the space shuttle.\n\nThe engines tested on Thursday contributed to 21 successful shuttle flights over the vehicle's 30-year operational history.\n\nTwo were used on the last space shuttle mission, STS-135 in 2011. One flew on the 1998 mission that launched the oldest person ever to go to space - US senator and Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time. The other was used on one of the flights to service the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe engines were refurbished following shuttle missions, but they will be discarded after the maiden flight of the SLS later this year.\n\nThat mission, called Artemis-1, will send Nasa's next-generation crew vehicle, Orion, around the Moon to thoroughly test its systems.\n\nTom Whitmeyer, from Exploration Systems Development at Nasa, said it would take about a month to refurbish the core stage, after which it would be put on a ship to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare it for launch.\n\nHere, it will be installed on a structure called the mobile launcher between the two booster rockets, completing the SLS vehicle.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "A US private investigator has told BBC News he was paid by the Sun newspaper to obtain personal information about the Duchess of Sussex in the early days of her relationship with Prince Harry.\n\nBut Daniel Hanks says he unlawfully accessed detailed information including Meghan's social security number.\n\nThe Sun's publisher said it requested legitimate research and instructed Mr Hanks he must act lawfully.\n\nMeghan and Harry said it was a \"moment of reflection\" for the media industry.\n\nBBC News has seen the so-called \"comprehensive report on Meghan and her family\" which the investigator, also known as Danno Hanks, passed to the Sun.\n\nIt included her phone number, addresses and social security number as well as information on her family members. His report also included information on her ex-husband and a former boyfriend.\n\nIn the US, licensed private investigators are allowed full access to databases of personal information for some permitted reasons such as court reports. But accessing this additional level of detail for journalistic purposes is unlawful.\n\nMr Hanks said: \"Pretty much everything I found out they could find out themselves using legal means - with the exception of the social security numbers.\n\n\"When you have that information\u2026 it's the key to the kingdom.\"\n\nWhile there is no evidence it happened in this instance, social security numbers in particular could potentially be used to further other intrusive investigations.\n\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex feel that today is an important moment of reflection for the media industry and society at large, as this investigative report shows that the predatory practices of days past are still ongoing, reaping irreversible damage for families and relationships.\n\n\"They are grateful to those working in media who stand for upholding the values of journalism, which are needed now more than ever before.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan recently took part in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey\n\nThe duke and duchess have had a fraught relationship with the UK's tabloid press. During the couple's recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, they said this had created a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\" and was largely to blame for them leaving the UK.\n\nPrince Harry is currently suing the publisher of the Sun, and the former publisher of the Daily Mirror, over allegations of phone hacking before 2011.\n\nSeveral stories appeared in the Sun, and other newspapers, at the beginning of the couple's relationship. They included an article claiming Prince Harry had \"bombarded\" his future wife with text messages and another detailing a weekend they spent together at Meghan's home in Toronto.\n\nDanno Hanks worked as a private investigator in the US for over 40 years gathering information on celebrities and high-profile people including Michael Jackson and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHe achieved some notoriety in the 1990s via appearances on daytime television and has been jailed four times, most recently in 2017 for extortion.\n\nMr Hanks said he had provided reports for most of the British tabloid newspapers.\n\nHe said the Sun wrote to him after the Leveson Inquiry into press standards and asked him to sign documents, seen by the BBC, committing to act within the law and he repeated this assurance when he billed the Sun for his work.\n\nBut he claims no-one ever asked where he got his information. \"They didn't care. They just wanted the information,\" he said.\n\nMr Hanks came forward after being approached by Graham Johnson, a freelance journalist and editor of Byline Investigates, which publishes stories on the British media.\n\nMr Johnson, a former investigations editor at the Sunday Mirror, pleaded guilty to two counts of phone hacking in 2013.\n\nHis website has received money from prominent supporters of press reform, including actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, who were both victims of phone hacking, and his partner Emma Jones is on the board of Hacked Off, the press reform campaign group.\n\nMr Johnson, who paid Mr Hanks for access to his documents, said: \"This story definitely sticks out in the post-Leveson world because it has taken place five years after we thought these practices had stopped.\"\n\nMost victims of phone-hacking have settled their claims. Prince Harry hasn't. That's the vital context of this story.\n\nIn the course of nearly a year reporting on the complex, often fraught relationship between the monarchy and the media, it's become clear that he is, in an important sense, the last man standing among those victims.\n\nA News UK source told me that it was a \"huge priority\" and \"preoccupation\" for the company to repair relations with the royals after the severe damage done by the hacking revelations.\n\nBut the revelation that the Sun paid a private investigator to supply information on Meghan and her family, and that too in the period leading up to Prince Harry's bombshell public statement of 8 November 2016 in which he said a line had been crossed, will not improve relations.\n\nPrince Harry has been advised by many people both to make peace with Britain's tabloids, and to settle his claims against them. He hasn't. He may strike some journalists as an unlikely champion of press reform. But it is a role he seems keen on.\n\nMr Hanks, who has now retired, said watching Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah had also prompted him to speak out.\n\n\"I'm just doing it to clear my conscience,\" he said.\n\nAsked what he would say to Meghan and Harry directly, he said: \"I'm deeply sorry for what I did... and I'm available if your lawyers need to talk to me. I'm ready to give you what I know. Supply you with any information. I just wish this had never happened.\"\n\nIn a statement, News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun - said: \"In 2016, the Sun made a legitimate request of Mr Hanks to research contact details and addresses for Meghan Markle and possible relatives using legal databases which he had a license to use. He was paid $250.\n\n\"Mr Hanks was not tasked to do anything illegal or breach any privacy laws - indeed he was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully and he signed a legal undertaking that he would do so.\n\n\"The information he provided could not and did not raise any concerns that he had used illegal practices to obtain the information.\n\n\"At no time did the Sun request the social security number of Meghan Markle, nor use the information he provided for any unlawful practice.\n\n\"The Sun abides by all laws and regulations and maintains strict protocols in relation to the obtaining of information from third parties. Strict compliance is in place to cover all our reporting.\"",

Remind yourself what the very sorry saga is all about here.\n\nWhat we know from inside that committee room is that the MSPs have voted by a margin of one vote, 5-4, that Nicola Sturgeon misled them.\n\nBefore we see the final report, which may not come for a while, it's hard to know what caveats they have applied, precisely what the circumstances are that they describe. The details will matter.\n\nMs Sturgeon's team is already trying to dismiss the findings as a partisan attack, a predictable political play from a committee of MSPs, designed to damage the first minister, whose popularity they envy, who has been almost untouchable for so long.\n\nThe findings they really fear are from the separate Hamilton Inquiry, being carried out by an independent lawyer in to whether she broke the rules that govern ministers' behaviour.\n\nIf she's found to have done that, convention suggests she would have to resign.\n\nIt is clear that Nicola Sturgeon has no intention of giving into opposition demands out there to get her to quit on the basis of the MSPs' conclusions.\n\nOf course this is intensely political, it's not just about who said what, when and where.\n\nBut a public finding from a parliamentary committee that she misled them can't just be brushed away.\n\nIt's a serious accusation from a group of senior politicians after an investigation that looked at thousands of pages of evidence.\n\nIt's a huge distraction just before the official start of vital Scottish elections. It underlines the bitter lines drawn inside the SNP during this saga.\n\nAnd it's damaging to the reputation of one of the country's most important politicians, whose personal standing is key not just to what happens in Scotland, but what happens to the whole of the UK.\n\nThe SNP has been all powerful under Ms Sturgeon's leadership. And her personal profile has been a vital part of creating a powerful political sense, although importantly never a certainty, that another referendum on Scottish independence was somehow inevitable.\n\nIf the SNP clinches a majority in May, it's her intention to use that to claim a mandate for another ballot. (Remember, it is also the UK government's firm intention to say no, which is, as things stand, its legal right.)\n\nBut in turn, anything that tarnishes her, could damage the SNP's standing in those May elections.\n\nAnd anything that harms her credibility, chips away at the sometimes lazy political sentiment, that the events of the last few years have set Scotland firmly on a path out of the UK.\n\nThe arguments of a group of politicians won't settle all of this.\n\nBut what they decide is one part of the overall wrangle over the future of the union itself.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Care workers across the UK who have to sleep at their workplace in case they are needed are not entitled to the minimum wage for their whole shift, the Supreme Court has ruled.\n\nThe case was brought by Clare Tomlinson-Blake against the learning disability charity, Mencap.\n\nIf she had won, care providers feared an estimated \u00a3400m bill for backpay, which they said they could not afford.\n\nThe case sought to overturn a 2018 Court of Appeal ruling.\n\nHer union, Unison, argued on her behalf that care staff should get the minimum wage for nightshifts even if they are asleep.\n\nMs Tomlinson-Blake told the BBC she was \"stunned\" by the ruling.\n\n\"I was deeply disappointed. I thought this was an opportunity for things to change, and for health and social care workers to start to be valued more, and the work that they do, which is the most important work that you can ever do,\" she said.\n\n\"Caring for another person that should be valued and just isn't being.\"\n\nShe added: \"Sleep-in shifts aren't about just being on call. It's work.\n\n\"Staff are constantly on guard to protect the most vulnerable in society. The sound of a cough in the night could mean someone's in danger.\"\n\nUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said: \"No-one is a winner from today's judgement.\n\n\"Everyone loses until the government intervenes to mend a broken system that relies on paying skilled staff a pittance.\"\n\nMrs Tomlinson-Blake, from East Yorkshire, was paid less than \u00a330 by Mencap for a sleep-in shift between 22:00 and 07:00.\n\nAlthough she could sleep, she was expected to keep a \"listening ear\" out for the home's residents and provide them with support if needed during the night.\n\nOver 16 months, she was called on six times, receiving no extra money for the first hour she was disturbed, although after that she was paid at the full day-time rate.\n\nA second case was brought by John Shannon, a Surrey care worker whose case was heard at the same time as Mrs Tomlinson-Blake's.\n\nHis case against his former employers was also dismissed.\n\nSome care workers are expected to sleep on site in between shifts\n\nThe Supreme Court concluded there was an exemption in national minimum wage legislation which applied to sleep-ins.\n\nIn the court's written ruling, Lady Arden said that \"sleep-in workers... are not doing time work for the purposes of the national minimum wage if they are not awake\".\n\nEdel Harris, chief executive of Mencap, said: \"Support workers within Mencap and across the sector do an exceptional job.\n\n\"They are dedicated in their care for people with a learning disability and should be paid more.\"\n\nBut she added: \"It is no exaggeration to say that if the ruling had been different, it would have severely impacted on a sector which is already underfunded and stretched to breaking point.\n\n\"Some providers would have gone bust and, ultimately, the people who rely on care would have suffered.\"\n\nA Downing Street spokesman praised the \"tireless\" work of care workers but would not say whether social care reforms, promised this year, would address the issue of overnight pay.\n\n\"We are aware of the judgement from the Supreme Court,\" said the spokesman.\n\n\"Care workers perform a vital role and they have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to support our most vulnerable, and we are committed to supporting them.\"\n\nLiz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, said the ruling showed the law on sleep-in shifts was \"unfair and in urgent need of updating\".\n\n\"This must form a part of the social care reforms we expect from ministers later this year,\" said Ms Kendall.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Peloton has warned parents to keep children away from its treadmills after the death of a child.\n\nBoss John Foley called it \"tragic accident\" - one of a \"small handful\" of incidents in which children have been hurt on the firm's exercise equipment.\n\nHe did not disclose further details about what happened.\n\nIn a separate incident, a 3-year-old suffered head injuries after getting trapped under a Peloton treadmill, but will make a full recovery.\n\nThe latest incident report into that accident, disclosed on Wednesday, said the child \"was found to have tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill\".\n\nMr Foley, Peloton's founder, said children should stay away from the firm's machines, which have surged in popularity during the pandemic.\n\n\"We design and build all of our products with safety in mind. But in order to help ensure that you and your family members stay safe with Peloton products in your home, we need your help,\" he wrote in the letter to customers.\n\n\"Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.\"\n\nThe US Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was investigating the incident.\n\nPeloton sells cycling machines and treadmills that can be connected online to virtual fitness classes. Its business has boomed as people look for alternative ways to exercise during lockdowns and gym closures.\n\nThe firm has said the skyrocketing demand has created supply chain pressures, leading to backlogs in orders for the machines.\n\nIts treadmills, which sell for more than $2,400 (\u00a31,722), were designed for use by those aged 16 and older, who weigh at least 105 pounds, it said.\n\nMr Foley said the company did not intend to release more information about the accidents, in order to respect privacy of those involved.\n\n\"While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved,\" he wrote.\n\nThe company is \"currently assessing ways to reinforce our warnings about these critical safety precautions to hopefully prevent future accidents,\" he added.\n\nLast year, Peloton recalled about 27,000 bikes in the US, citing problems after clip-on pedals broke unexpectedly during use.\n\nThere were an estimated 22,500 treadmill-related injuries treated at US emergency departments among all ages, including around 2,000 involving children under the age of eight, according to the consumer product safety commission.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, it received reports of 17 deaths related to the use of a treadmill, including one involving a 5-year-old.",

            "content": "A reporter with the BBC Burmese service has been detained in Myanmar as clashes continue between security forces and protesters.\n\nAung Thura was taken away by men in plain clothes while reporting outside a court in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw.\n\nThe BBC said in a statement that it was extremely concerned and called on the authorities to help locate him.\n\nAt least eight people are reported to have died in the most recent protests, which took place in several cities.\n\nAung Thura was taken away with another reporter, Than Htike Aung, who works for the local news organisation Mizzima. Mizzima's operating licence was revoked by the military government earlier this month.\n\nThe men who detained the journalists arrived in an unmarked van at around midday local time (05:30 GMT) on Friday and demanded to see them. The BBC has been unable to contact Aung Thura since.\n\n\"The BBC takes the safety of all its staff in Myanmar very seriously and we are doing everything we can to find Aung Thura,\" the corporation said in a statement.\n\n\"We call on the authorities to help locate him and confirm that he is safe. Aung Thura is an accredited BBC journalist with many years of reporting experience covering events in Nay Pyi Taw.\"\n\nForty journalists have been arrested since a military coup on 1 February, which saw the detention of elected civilian leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi. Sixteen are still in custody, and the military has revoked the licences of five media companies.\n\nThe eight people killed on Friday were shot dead by security forces in the central town of Aungban, according to a funeral director and local media.\n\n\"Security forces came to remove barriers but the people resisted and they fired shots,\" a witness told Reuters news agency.\n\nReports from Yangon say the streets have been congested as many people try to flee violence in the country's main city. Police there are also said to be forcing people to remove barricades put up by protesters.\n\nPost-coup violence has claimed the lives of at least 232 Burmese, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group says. One of the bloodiest days was 14 March when 38 were killed.\n\nProtesters at barricades in Yangon's Thaketa township on Friday\n\nA joint statement by European Union embassies and those of the US and the UK condemned \"the brutal violence against unarmed civilians by security forces\".\n\nThe statement called on the military to lift martial law, release detainees, end the state of emergency and restore democracy.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has meanwhile criticised the use of lethal force by the military and called for \"a path towards peaceful solutions\".\n\nHe echoed a call by the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to hold a summit on the situation in Myanmar.",
