            "section": "Manchester",
            "content": "Simon Beswick was the leader of a specialist paramedic team on the night of the attack\n\nA senior paramedic has told an inquiry he was wrong not to send three colleagues straight to the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing.\n\nSimon Beswick arrived at the arena 40 minutes after the blast, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.\n\nThe inquiry has heard how only three paramedics treated casualties in the City Room, where the bomb exploded.\n\nThree additional paramedics were held back to treat patients on the Victoria Station concourse outside the arena.\n\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\n\nMr Beswick told the public inquiry into the attack that two of his North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) colleagues had gone into the City Room foyer while he and three other colleagues, who arrived later, remained outside to assist with casualties there.\n\n\"On reflection and with the benefit of hindsight, yes I believe I was incorrect in my decision making there and we could have moved forward,\" he said.\n\n\"But on the evening, the challenges we faced, I believe I was robust in my decision making not to overcommit members of the team and to allocate [them] to treat critically-ill patients at that point.\"\n\nMr Beswick, who was acting up as team leader of NWAS's Hazardous Area Response Team (HART), said making the decision had caused him a \"great deal of disquiet and concern\".\n\nHe said he had been informed the scene had not been declared safe at that stage and there was a concern over secondary devices or another terrorist attack.\n\nTwenty-two people died in the attack on 22 May 2017\n\nMr Beswick told the inquiry Dan Smith, a NWAS operational commander, had asked him to stay back and set up a casualty collection point on the station concourse while two paramedics were sent into the City Room to triage and treat patients.\n\nWhen asked if he was surprised he was not sent to the scene, Mr Beswick said the \"amount of patients was overwhelming and there was nowhere to treat them\".\n\nWhen three more members of the HART team arrived, they were asked to treat patients who were being carried out on makeshift stretchers, rather than go into the foyer, the inquiry heard.\n\nAt one stage Mr Beswick spent three minutes helping three casualties walk across the road outside the station, the hearing was told.\n\nHe accepted that a paramedic with his skills \"could have been more effective moving forward\" to help other patients.\n\nChristopher Hargreaves was one of the paramedics who was sent into the City Room\n\nMr Beswick also told the inquiry he had to \"play the role of a parking officer\" at times because there was no traffic officer on the scene.\n\nThe inquiry also heard from HART paramedic Christopher Hargreaves, who said he was with Mr Beswick when a radio message came through at about 22.40 BST regarding an \"ongoing bombing or shooting\" at the arena.\n\nHe said: \"It seemed a little bit chaotic trying to get some more information from control once we had set off.\"\n\nHe told the inquiry Mr Beswick looked on Twitter to try to gather more information, which he agreed was not ideal.\n\nHe said: \"At the time it was our only option.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Donald Trump's net worth dropped by about $700m to $2.3bn (\u00a31.65bn) during his time as president, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic hit his fortunes hard, with Mr Trump's office buildings, branded hotels and resorts losing revenue and falling in value.\n\nHis fleet of planes and golf courses have also seen drops in their value.\n\nMr Trump is currently under a criminal investigation into his financial affairs and his family business.\n\nBloomberg analysed financial documents and other filings from May 2016 and January 2021 to calculate Mr Trump's wealth before and after he became US president.\n\nMr Trump's commercial real estate accounts for about three-quarters of his net worth. The office towers he owns or co-owns have seen big drops in valuations as more people work from home, a trend that could last in the long term.\n\nBloomberg, which provides financial news and data, estimates a 26% drop in the value of his main commercial property holdings.\n\nHe also owns, manages or licenses his name to about a dozen hotels and resorts, plus 19 golf courses.\n\nAlthough golf has become popular during the pandemic as a socially distanced outdoor sport, Mr Trump's two courses in Scotland have consistently lost money, filings show.\n\nAfter the Capitol Hill siege in January, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) of America ended an agreement to host its 2022 championship tournament at Mr Trump's New Jersey golf course, saying it would hurt the group's brand.\n\nDeutsche Bank, the only bank willing to lend to him after his bankruptcies in the 1990s, also said after the riots that it would not do business with him again.\n\nMr Trump also owns a fleet of planes that includes a Boeing 757. These planes are decades old and have been marked down in value over the years, according to financial disclosures seen by Bloomberg.\n\nSeven planes were valued at around $59m in 2015 and five were valued at about $6.5m in 2020. The value of Mr Trump's aircraft has dropped over the years, in part because he has sold some of his fleet.\n\nDuring his presidency, Mr Trump's finances were regularly in the spotlight and he has been very secretive about how much tax he pays.\n\nLast month the Supreme Court ordered Mr Trump to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York.\n\nFor months they have been trying to obtain eight years' worth of Mr Trump's personal and corporate tax returns.\n\nThe investigation was originally started in 2018 to examine the Trump Organization's role in hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had had affairs with Mr Trump.\n\nAs a former president, Donald Trump can expect to sign some lucrative media deals to recover some of his lost wealth, such as a post-presidential memoir.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama reportedly got paid about $65m for their memoirs, while Bill Clinton earned a $15m advance for his 2004 book.\n\nBloomberg says the most obvious way Mr Trump can profit post-presidency is with a news channel or social media platform that would appeal to his 74m voters in the 2020 election.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, Boris Johnson has said, adding he will be receiving it himself on Friday.\n\nThe benefits of the vaccine preventing Covid far outweighed any risks, the prime minister said, as he urged people to take up the jab when offered.\n\nIt comes after UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the Covid vaccine caused blood clots.\n\nMr Johnson also said delays to vaccine supply next month would not affect England's roadmap out of lockdown.\n\n\"The progress along the road to freedom remains unchecked,\" he told a Downing Street briefing, after NHS England warned vaccine supplies would be reduced in April.\n\nProf Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told the briefing the Covid vaccines were \"very effective\" against what remained a \"very dangerous disease for many people\".\n\nHe added that there were \"real issues that we always have to think about with all drugs\", but they were \"so much smaller than the benefits of getting the vaccine\".\n\n\"The risk-benefit is really strongly in favour of getting vaccinated,\" he said.\n\nRegulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain, prompting some European countries to pause rollout.\n\nBut earlier, the MHRA and the EMA said people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised.\n\nFrance and Italy have since announced that they will resume using the jab.\n\nA phrase used repeatedly today is the risk-benefit ratio. But what does that mean?\n\nThe EU and UK regulators were unable to completely rule out the vaccine as a cause of rare blood clots that have been seen.\n\nBecause the clots are so rare, it is hard to tell if they are above the levels you would normally expect without vaccination.\n\nBut even if a link is proven - and there is no suggestion it will be - the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.\n\nThere have been 18 cases of this rare blood clot out of 20 million vaccinations in Europe. That's about one in a million.\n\nSomeone who is over the age of 75 and becomes infected with Covid has a one in nine chance of dying.\n\nEven in younger age groups the benefits are clear. Someone in their 40s has a one in 1,000 risk of dying.\n\nThe vaccines have been proved to be highly effective. They will save lives, rather than cost them.\n\nAlso during the briefing, Mr Johnson confirmed that supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been affected by a delayed shipment from the Serum Institute of India.\n\nAfter opening up appointments to all over-50s on Wednesday, the NHS in England was then told not to offer jabs to younger age groups throughout April.\n\n\"There is a delay as I have described, as there are very frequently in vaccine rollout programmes,\" he said.\n\nHe put it down to \"various technical reasons\" and said the Indian government \"hasn't stopped any export\".\n\nThe Serum Institute of India is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and is making one billion doses of the AstraZeneca jab this year for low and middle-income countries.\n\nEarlier this month, it agreed to supply 10 million doses for the UK, but only half of these will arrive this month with the rest held up by four weeks.\n\nThe Serum Institute said: \"Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India.\"\n\nIts chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, has previously called for patience over global vaccine deliveries, saying the company has been \"directed to prioritise the huge needs of India\".\n\nHe has also raised concerns about raw material shortages, attributing this to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines, such as specialised bags and filters.",

Ms Watanabe has yet to respond.\n\nThe incident comes after ex-Games president Yoshiro Mori was forced to quit for making sexist remarks.\n\n\"There was a very inappropriate expression in my ideas and remarks,\" Mr Sasaki said in a statement released through the Games organising committee. \"I sincerely apologise to her and people who have felt discomfort with such content.\"\n\nNaomi Watanabe is one of Japan's most well-known comedians\n\nMs Watanabe, 33, is one of Japan's most famous comedians, and is known for her celebrity impersonations and body positivity advocacy work.\n\nIn recent years she has spearheaded a body positive movement called \"pochakawaii\", which translates to \"chubby and cute\", and in 2014 she started one of Japan's first brands to offer plus-size clothing.\n\nMr Sasaki, 66, who is in charge of the Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, had made the suggestions involving Watanabe last year via a group chat on messaging app Line. The proposal was immediately rejected by his colleagues, who told him it was inappropriate.\n\nHis resignation came shortly after weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported his remarks on Wednesday.\n\nOrganisers have said that current Games president Seiko Hashimoto plans to address the matter at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nFormer Olympian and Japan's ex-Olympics minister Ms Hashimoto was appointed Games president last month after Mr Mori sparked backlash when he said that women talk too much. He also said that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\".\n\nSince taking on the role, Ms Hashimoto has pledged to make gender equality a top priority at the Games, adding 12 female directors to the organising committee's executive board.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "The prime minister's former aide, Dominic Cummings, has criticised the Department of Health as \"a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE\" at the start of the pandemic.\n\nHe said that was why Boris Johnson had taken direct control of the vaccine programme.\n\nHe also told MPs Mr Johnson approached him about working in Downing Street the week before he took office.\n\nHe said he asked him to \"help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare\".\n\nMr Cummings said he agreed but one of his preconditions was that science funding should be doubled.\n\nHe was giving evidence to MPs on the Science and Technology Committee about the creation of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency know as Aria.\n\nBut in his first public appearance since leaving office, he also criticised the health department's response to the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \"In spring 2020 you had a situation where the Department for Health was just a smoking ruin in terms of procurement and PPE and all of that, you had serious problems with the funding bureaucracy for therapeutics on Covid.\"\n\nHe said the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had advised Number 10 that the vaccine rollout should not be run out of the Department for Health and that a separate task force should be created.\n\n\"It's not coincidental that the vaccine programme worked the way it did. It's not coincidental that to do that we had to take it out of the Department of Health,\" he added.\n\n\"We had to have it authorised very directly by the prime minister and say strip away all the normal nonsense that we can see is holding back funding.\"\n\nBut a source at the health department told the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming that getting the vaccine programme established was a \"massive team effort\".\n\nThey added: \"Everyone in DHSC was and is spending their time focused on saving lives, expanding the world leading vaccine rollout and getting through this pandemic.\"\n\nThe Vaccine Taskforce is a team of almost 200 people at the Department for Business that was established to make sure the UK got promising vaccines.\n\nMr Cummings said as the country emerges from lockdown there needs to be an \"urgent very, very hard look\" by Parliament at \"what went wrong and why\" during the pandemic.\n\n\"One of the most obvious lessons is the incredible value potentially of getting science and technology stuff right, the disaster that can come if you don't get it right.\"\n\nIt was this \"horrific Whitehall bureaucracy\" he wanted to strip away when he championed the new \"high risk\" Aria scientific research agency, he told MPs.\n\nHe said: \"The prime minister came to speak to me the Sunday before he became prime minister and said: 'Would I come in to Downing Street to try and help sort out the huge Brexit nightmare?'.\n\n\"I said, yes, if first of all you are deadly serious about actually getting Brexit done and avoiding a second referendum; secondly, double the science budget; third, create some Aria like entity, and fourth support me in trying to change how Whitehall works and the Cabinet Office works because it is a disaster zone. And he said 'deal'.\"\n\nAnswering MPs' questions about science funding, Mr Cummings said scientists had been lobbying for the creation of a body such as Aria that would have \"extreme freedom\" but he said he was aware that this was \"completely hostile to normal bureaucracy\".\n\nThe government says Aria will fund \"high-risk, high-reward\" scientific research and \"help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower\".\n\nIt will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS.\n\nAria, which has \u00a3800m funding over four years, will have a \"higher tolerance for failure than is normal\", ministers say.\n\nBut the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).\n\nFor 2020-21, the government has allocated \u00a310.36bn for its research programmes and bodies.\n\nLabour said there needed to be greater transparency around how the agency would operate.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler, who sits on the science committee, said because Aria was exempt from freedom of information requests this would undoubtedly \"raise alarm bells\" about how taxpayers' money would be spent given \"the recent PPE scandals\".\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the \"corporate governance arrangements are very robust\".\n\nHe added he would be responsible for reporting to Parliament on Aria and that the agency would have to submit accounts that would be scrutinised by MPs.\n\n\"I think there will be a great deal of transparency and oversight,\" he added.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, chair Greg Clark said Mr Cummings had agreed to give evidence on the Covid pandemic to a joint inquiry by the science and health committees.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The outlook for the UK economy remains \"unusually uncertain\" despite the rapid rollout of the vaccine programme, the Bank of England has said.\n\nIt said it expected an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures were eased and government support for jobs continued.\n\nBut it said the recovery still depended on the \"evolution of the pandemic\" and measures to protect public health.\n\nIt came as the Bank held interest rates at historic lows of 0.1%.\n\nAccording to official figures, the UK economy shrank by 2.9% in January amid the third lockdown, as restaurants and non-essential shops were shuttered.\n\nBut the drop was much smaller than expected, suggesting businesses have adapted to trading in lockdown.\n\nIt's added to growing expectations that the recovery will be stronger than previously expected, thanks in large part to the vaccine programme.\n\nDespite concerns about supply, everyone above the age of 50 and all adults in risk groups are set to have their first jab by the end of May, followed by all adults by the end of July.\n\nLast week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that he expected the economy to \"get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019\".\n\nMeanwhile, the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts that unemployment will peak at 6.5% instead of the 11.9% predicted last July.\n\nHowever, an official statement on Thursday from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, was more cautious.\n\nIt said recent plans to ease lockdown \"may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook\" in the near term, but it was unclear whether they would make a difference in the medium-term.\n\n\"The outlook for the UK economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain,\" it added.\n\n\"It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments.\"\n\nSilvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, said the cautious tone of the MPC's statement was in line with other central banks.\n\n\"The Bank of England is facing the same cross-currents. Since its previous meeting in February, most developments - notably fresh rounds of fiscal stimulus domestically and abroad - have had positive implications for the economic outlook, but downside risks and uncertainty concerning the evolution of the pandemic are still prominent.\"\n\nThere have been warnings that inflation could breach the Bank's 2% target this year, but Mr Bailey has played the threat down.\n\nOn Thursday, the MPC said it would continue to monitor the situation closely but had no immediate plans tighten monetary policy.\n\nBut it said if the outlook for inflation weakens, \"the committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit\".\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve also played down warnings of rising inflation, saying any increases above its own 2% target were likely to be \"transient\".\n\nToday's Monetary Policy Report plays down the risk of a rate rise any time soon. And the BoE has more than one reason to do so.\n\nThe pandemic has brought weirdness to many of our lives. The same applies to the Bank of England. It continues to insist it doesn't engage in monetary financing, where the central bank simply creates money from nothing (once upon a time you could say \"prints money\" but now it's digital) and \"lends\" it to the government.\n\nHowever, what's happening now is not much different. As the Financial Times has noted, of the money being borrowed by the government this financial year by issuing gilts - a sort of IOU note also known as a government bond - 92.7% of it will be owed to the Bank of England.\n\nNot only is the government \"borrowing\" most of its money from another branch of the public sector. If it pays interest on that debt it gets it straight back. Easy money. But the money the BoE creates from nothing is used to buy gilts from big City players like pension funds, hoping they'll invest the cash in productive industry (the last 12 years by no means supports that hope).\n\nWhat they get in exchange is BoE reserves, which pay interest at the official rate. So if rates rose, the BoE - underwritten by the Treasury - would be one of the biggest losers.",

Perhaps it's less fixed desks and more casual meeting areas, and we need to consider colleague wellbeing, too,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he emphasised that plans to sell Waterside were still at a very early stage. It is thought the airline has only recently hired property consultants to evaluate options.\n\nIn a separate statement to the BBC, BA said on Thursday: \"The global pandemic has shown us that many of our colleagues enjoy working remotely and want to continue, and this has accelerated our approach to offering more agile and flexible ways of working.\n\n\"Our aim is to find a hybrid working model that suits our business, blending the best of office and remote working for our people. We've also re-structured our business to emerge from the crisis and are considering whether we still have the need for such a large headquarters building.\"\n\nThe move to hybrid working after the pandemic is growing.\n\nThe Nationwide building society has indicated that it does not intend to force people to return to the office if they have been successfully able to work from home during the pandemic.\n\nOil giant BP has told office-based staff they can spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease.\n\nAnd banks HSBC and Lloyds are among many other companies looking into split working arrangements.\n\nEarlier this month the boss of IWG, which provides office space across the world, told the BBC he expected hybrid working \"to become the norm\" for many companies.\n\nMark Dixon said: \"It works for companies, because it's a lot cheaper. It's also much, much better for the environment.\"",

            "section": "Africa",
            "content": "Tanzania's President John Magufuli has died aged 61, the country's vice-president has announced.\n\nHe died on Wednesday from heart complications at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, Samia Suluhu Hassan said in an address on state television.\n\nMr Magufuli had not been seen in public for more than two weeks, and rumours had been circulating about his health.\n\nOpposition politicians said last week that he had contracted Covid-19, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nMr Magufuli was one of Africa's most prominent coronavirus sceptics, and called for prayers and herbal-infused steam therapy to counter the virus.\n\n\"It is with deep regret that I inform you that today... we lost our brave leader, the president of the Republic of Tanzania, John Pombe Magufuli,\" Vice-President Hassan said in the announcement.\n\nShe said there would be 14 days of national mourning and flags would fly at half mast.\n\nAccording to Tanzania's constitution, Ms Hassan will be sworn in as the new president within 24 hours and should serve the remainder of Mr Magufuli's five-year term which he began last year.\n\nMr Magufuli was last seen in public on 27 February, but Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa insisted last week that the president was \"healthy and working hard\".\n\nHe blamed the rumours of the president's ill-health on \"hateful\" Tanzanians living abroad.\n\nBut opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that his sources had told him Mr Magufuli was being treated in hospital for coronavirus in Kenya.\n\nWhen Covid-19 arrived in Tanzania, Mr Magufuli called on people to go to churches and mosques to pray. \"Coronavirus, which is a devil, cannot survive in the body of Christ... It will burn instantly,\" he said.\n\nHe declared Tanzania \"Covid-19 free\" last June, saying the virus had been eradicated by three days of national prayer.\n\nHe also mocked the efficacy of masks, expressed doubts about testing, and teased neighbouring countries which imposed health measures to curb the virus.\n\n\"Countries in Africa will be coming here to buy food in the years to come\u2026 they will be suffering because of shutting down their economy,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTanzania has not published details of its coronavirus cases since May, and the government has refused to purchase vaccines.\n\nOn Monday, police said they had arrested four people on suspicion of spreading rumours on social media that the president was ill.\n\n\"To spread rumours that he's sick smacks of hate,\" Mr Majaliwa said at the time.\n\nThe country is in a sombre mood - for the first time in its six decades of existence, Tanzania has lost a sitting president, John Pombe Magufuli.\n\nThe news of his death was received with shock and disbelief - although there were rumours of his illness, the authorities reassured the country that all was well with him.\n\nFrom his home district of Chato to the capital of Dodoma to the business hub of Dar es Salaam, most Tanzanians have been mourning Magufuli.\n\nThere are those with a different view, especially on social media led by exiled opposition politician Tundu Lissu, who has been speculating that President Magufuli had contracted Covid which led to his death, however the authorities have insisted the death was caused by heart complications.\n\nTanzanians are now turning their minds to the succession, which should see current Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan become the country's first female president.\n\nMr Magufuli was declared president on his 56th birthday in October 2015. He was elected for a second term following a disputed poll last year.\n\nHe was hailed for his anti-corruption stance during his time in office, but he was also accused of cracking down on dissent and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\nHis critics agree that Mr Magufuli contributed to Tanzania's development. He invested in large infrastructure projects such as a standard-gauge railway to connect the country with its neighbours, major highways, and a bus system in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam.\n\nHe also increased electricity production, reducing the need for power rationing.\n\nBut it is his approach to Covid-19 that many analysts say will define his legacy.\n\nIn Tanzania, people have reacted with grief and disbelief to the news of Mr Magufuli's death.\n\nOne, Joseph Petro, told the BBC he thought Mr Magufuli was a \"caring\" leader, adding \"he was helping people in one way or another\".\n\n\"I am really pained. I am personally pained,\" he said.\n\nAnother, Illuminata Abel, offered similar sentiments: \"He was not my relative, but he was someone who listened to people's problems, and he was down to earth.\"\n\nAfrican leaders have also come out to pay tribute.\n\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said: \"I have lost a friend, colleague and visionary ally,\" and declared a seven-day period of national mourning in Kenya.\n\nFormer Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called Mr Magufuli a \"partner in democracy\" and a \"patriot who loved his country\".\n\nBut Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu told the BBC that Mr Magufuli's \"politics, policies and Covid denialism\" had \"driven the country towards disaster\".",

            "content": "Individuals' human rights may have been breached in more than 500 cases where \"do not resuscitate\" decisions were made during the Covid pandemic, the care watchdog for England has said.\n\nSome 508 'do not attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) decisions made since March 2020 were not agreed in discussion with the person or their family, a report found.\n\nThe Care Quality Commission is calling for improvements to care planning.\n\nAn NHS spokesman said decisions should be made in consultation with families.\n\nThe CQC has recommended that a ministerial oversight group be created to work with health and care providers, local government and the voluntary sector to deliver improvements.\n\nIt wants to see a consistent national approach to advance care planning, with staff training, accessible information for families and records of conversations and decisions agreed.\n\nThe findings come after the CQC was asked by the Department of Health and Social Care to conduct a rapid review of how DNAR decisions were used at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt followed concerns that decisions were being made without the involvement of patients or relatives, and that they were being applied in a blanket way to particular groups - to people with learning disabilities, for example.\n\nAn interim report published by the care watchdog in December found that doctors may have made \"do not resuscitate\" decisions on a blanket basis in the first wave of the pandemic.\n\nAn NHS spokesman said: \"The NHS has repeatedly instructed local clinicians and services that the blanket DNA(CPR) decisions would be unacceptable - including on three separate occasions in less than a month at the start of the pandemic, and again last week - and that access to treatment and care for people should be and is made on an individual basis in consultation with family and carers.\"\n\nIn its latest report, the CQC said that a combination of \"unprecedented pressure\" on providers and \"rapidly developing guidance\" may have led to situations where DNAR decisions were incorrectly conflated with other clinical assessments.\n\nThere were examples of good practice but the regulator also found a \"worrying picture\" of poor involvement of people using services, poor record keeping, and a lack of oversight and scrutiny of the decisions being made.\n\nHowever, it noted that the issues raised - such as the need for proper, consistent processes around timely conversations about people's care - pre-dated the pandemic.\n\nThe report includes evidence from seven Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), responses from adult social care providers, a public survey and voluntary sector organisations.\n\nSome 2,048 adult social care providers responded to the CQC, and said that 508 DNAR decisions made since 17 March 2020 had not been agreed in discussion with the person, their relative or carer.\n\nAround a third (180) were still in place in December.\n\nAnd, while responsibility for making DNAR decisions does not largely rest with adult social care providers, 119 providers said people in their care had been subject to blanket DNAR decisions since March 2020.\n\nThe CQC said the figures raised concerns about whether the providers making these decisions were at risk of breaching the Equality Act 2010.\n\nMost providers of adult social care, and primary and secondary care, said they were not aware of inappropriate DNAR decisions.\n\nBut other stakeholders, service users, families and carers said blanket DNAR decisions had been proposed locally.\n\nThe regulator heard evidence that these decisions were \"quickly challenged and retracted\".\n\nRosie Benneyworth, chief inspector of Primary Medical Services and Integrated Care at the CQC, said: \"It is vital we get this right and ensure better end-of-life care as a whole health and social care system, with health and social care providers, local government and the voluntary sector working together.\n\n\"Covid-19 has brought this to the fore but these are not new issues.\"\n\nAge UK said the approach to advance care planning needed a \"complete overhaul\", with strengthened support for professionals and families with concerns.\n\nIt is also calling for a review so that any \"hasty, ill-informed decisions\" could be removed from older people's records.\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Scorer, head of policy at the learning disability charity Mencap, said the review highlighted \"the urgent need for better staff training and support to ensure the right of people with a learning disability, and their families, to be involved in decisions about care and treatment is upheld\".\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Their public comments have made that clear.\n\n\"So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising.\n\n\"Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon.\"\n\nMr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be \"expected to offer their resignation\".\n\nHis inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days.\n\nThe cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman.\n\nA spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published.\n\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks.\n\nMr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a \"malicious scheme\" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon.\n\nBut Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were \"absurd\", and insisted she had not been out to \"get\" Mr Salmond.\n\nShe told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his \"cronies\" In the \"old boys' club\" had been spinning \"conspiracy theories\" which opposition politicians had bought into.\n\nIt came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a \"concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints\" against the former first minister.\n\nNicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to.\n\nAlex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018.\n\nNicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough.\n\nHer testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private.\n\nThe opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account.\n\nWith the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign.\n\n\"I have said for weeks that evidence against Nicola Sturgeon has been mounting, it has been growing and it is clear she has breached the ministerial code.\n\n\"You cannot continue as first minister of Scotland if you have misled Parliament and breached the ministerial code.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it would be \"incredibly serious\" if the committee concluded that the first minister had misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code.\n\nHe added: \"This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life.\"",

            "description": "As several countries pause the AstraZeneca jab, six reporters explain what is happening across Europe.",
            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "Several European countries are experiencing a new surge in coronavirus infections, while a number have also suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine over safety concerns.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency is standing by its decision to approve the vaccine and has reiterated there is \"no indication\" the jab causes blood clots. It is investigating further and its results are due to be released on Thursday.\n\nCorrespondents in six cities explain how Europeans are reacting to the new wave of infections and the stuttering rollout.\n\nVaccinations 857,792 |14.81 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared with last week +2,484\n\nDenmark was the first country in Europe to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution, followed by Norway and Iceland. It is yet another blow to its vaccine plans, writes Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen.\n\nAbout 1 in 10 people here have now received at least one vaccine dose, a quarter of which were supplied by AstraZeneca.\n\nAll adults were expected to be vaccinated by the end of June, but delivery delays have seen that target pushed back a number of times. Health authorities on Wednesday suggested the end of July.\n\nDanes have expressed disappointment about the rollout on Twitter. \"It's simply going too slow,\" writes Lone Juul Lang. But most have supported the government's handling of coronavirus and a survey in January revealed that almost nine out of 10 Danes want to be vaccinated.\n\nSince the new year, infections have fallen sharply and Denmark is slowly emerging from a second lockdown. But signs of fatigue are beginning to show. Anti-lockdown protests have recently been held in some Danish cities and there's political pressure to do more.\n\nHowever, concerns about new variants of coronavirus, have made the government hesitant to open up faster.\n\nVaccinations 7,552,120 | 11.19 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared with last week +25,912\n\nAfter an unpromising start, the AstraZeneca jab has come to hold a key place in France's inoculation programme, but a new poll on public confidence is not reassuring, writes Hugh Schofield in Paris.\n\nIt's the worst anniversary that Emmanuel Macron can have imagined, says Nicolas Beytout, editor of France's L'Opinion newspaper.\n\nExactly a year ago the president announced the first lockdown and said France was \"at war\" with the virus. But now his strategy has been knocked dangerously off course by the suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nIn recent weeks the AstraZeneca jab has overtaken Pfizer/BioNTech in the number of doses delivered.\n\nBut if people turn away from AstraZeneca, waiting for new vaccines like Johnson and Johnson, then Mr Macron's calculations go awry. The sweet moment when immunity starts biting is postponed, leading to lockdowns and public anger.\n\nAccording to an Elabe survey conducted just as the suspension was announced, only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca. For Pfizer/BioNTech, the figure is 52%.\n\nVaccinations 9,853,966 | 11.76 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +23,889\n\nCoronavirus infections are spreading fast again in Germany and there's already growing dissatisfaction over a slow vaccine rollout, writes Jenny Hill in Berlin.\n\n\"We wonder now when we will ever be vaccinated?\" says kindergarten worker Tanya.\n\nJust 8% of the German population has received a first jab in a country which, most experts agree, is firmly in the grip of a third wave.\n\nGermany has relied largely on Pfizer/BioNTech, but ministers need AstraZeneca if they're to keep their promises and speed things up.\n\nSo the decision to suspend the jab has caused dismay, anger and concern.\n\nNot least because, even in a country that is broadly open to vaccination, AstraZeneca has a bit of an image problem; in part, because the government initially blocked its use in older age groups.\n\nMinisters argue now, as then, that they're acting to create public trust. Many here would say they've had the opposite effect - undermining faith not just in the vaccine but, in an election year, the government itself.\n\nVaccinations 4,557,060 | 12.04 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +29,557\n\nIn Poland, new infections are rising at an alarming rate as the country's third wave continues to gather momentum, writes Adam Easton in Warsaw.\n\nIn response to the health ministry's latest tweet about the number of new cases, which rose by 45% compared with a week earlier, some wanted tougher restrictions.\n\n\"In Germany, a hard lockdown, in Poland indignation that you can't go to the pub in the evening,\" writes @JMojzych, adding that there is a higher rate of infection here than in Germany.\n\nIn terms of the vaccination rollout, Poland has just fallen out of the top 10 EU countries with the highest rate of administering jabs. A recent opinion poll found that 53.1% of respondents agreed the EU had failed to provide sufficient vaccines to member states.\n\nUnlike many EU countries, Poland is continuing to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nBut people questioning, or deferring their AstraZeneca jab has become \"a noticeable phenomenon\", Prof Agniezka Mastalerz-Migas, from Wroclaw Medical University, told broadcaster TVN24 .\n\nVaccinations 7,039,518 | 11.64 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +12,018\n\nThe timing could hardly have been worse for Italy, writes Mark Lowen in Milan.\n\nOn the day that most of Italy entered another lockdown and new vaccine sites opened to ramp up rollout, they were abruptly shut again with the AstraZeneca suspension - and those waiting for their longed-for panacea were turned away.\n\n\"Another failure by Europe,\" cried Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League. He adds that he hoped the Sputnik V vaccine would arrive soon - a comment not lost on those noting Mr Salvini's pro-Russia sympathies.\n\nAt a Pfizer vaccination centre in Milan, most seem unfazed.\n\n\"If my mother had got AstraZeneca today, not Pfizer, it would be the same,\" says Elena Grazena. \"I trust the science.\"\n\nMaria Polizzi tells me she is a little worried by the suspension. \"Luckily AstraZeneca wasn't the vaccine I got,\" she says. \"It's right they're suspending until they investigate.\"\n\nAmid a third wave and frustration at a slow vaccine rollout, it's as though this exhausted country has been kicked while it's down.\n\nVaccinations 1,079,144 | 11.98 doses per 100 people | Increase in cases compared to last week +1,876\n\nIn Austria, there are mixed feelings about AstraZeneca, writes Bethany Bell in Vienna.\n\nOn one of Vienna's main shopping streets, I meet Angelika, who tells me she is relieved to have had her first jab of AstraZeneca last week.\n\n\"I'm really happy and glad to have it because I'm a teacher,\" she tells me. \"I feel great. It was fine.\" She says it is much better to be inoculated than to get a bad case of Covid-19.\n\nAustria halted one batch of the vaccine last week, while they investigate the death of a nurse who died several days after being inoculated.\n\nAustria's health minister Rudolf Anschober has called for a swift European solution, instead of individual national decisions.\n\nEveryone will have to make up their own minds, says Angelika. \"I think we take a lot of other medicines where we don't know what's inside.\"\n\nAnother shopper, Manfred is more suspicious.\n\n\"In general, I am pro-vaccination,\" he tells me. But he says he won't take AstraZeneca at the moment, \"because of the serious adverse events. I'm a bit scared to get ill from the vaccine\".\n\nHe says he might change his mind if the studies are okay.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to see the full interactive Enter a country or territory to find out the progress of the vaccine rollout No vaccine data available.

He left the ITV programme later that day.\n\nThe total of 57,121 complaints is 12,600 more than those made over a race row on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007.\n\nThe duchess herself is among those who have complained to the watchdog.\n\nMorgan responded on Twitter: \"Only 57,000? I've had more people than that come up & congratulate me in the street for what I said. The vast majority of Britons are right behind me.\"\n\nOfcom, which has regulated British TV since 2003, has already launched an investigation into Good Morning Britain. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman said the investigation was ongoing.\n\nA further 4,398 complaints have been made about the Oprah interview itself, which was broadcast on ITV on 8 March. Some objected to the duke and duchess' claims about the Royal Family, some about the timing given the Duke of Edinburgh's ill health, and some about the use of allegedly misleading press headlines in the programme.\n\nOfcom said: \"We're assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate.\" The regulator did not say which aspect of the interview had attracted the complaints.\n\nIn the in-depth interview, Meghan told Oprah her mental health became so bad she \"didn't want to be alive any more\", that she did not receive the help she asked for from Buckingham Palace, and that an unnamed member of the Royal Family had queried \"how dark\" their son Archie's skin might be.\n\nThe day after its UK broadcast, Morgan said he did not believe her, adding that \"the fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible\".\n\nHe briefly walked off the programme after clashing with weather presenter Alex Beresford, and he was criticised by mental health charity Mind.\n\nMorgan later conceded that it was \"not for me to question if she felt suicidal\", but has defended his \"right to be allowed to have an opinion\".",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Proposals to reduce the dominance of the \"Big Four\" accountancy firms and scrap the industry regulator have been unveiled by the government.\n\nThe aim is to improve regulatory standards after high profile corporate failures such as Carillion and BHS.\n\nAlso, company directors will face more responsibility to ensure accounts are accurate, or face tougher penalties.\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the changes would help restore confidence in business.\n\nThere will now be a 16-week consultation on the proposals.\n\nThe business of auditing companies' accounts, and ensuring they are a fair reflection of their financial health, is dominated by four accountancy firms: KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY.\n\nHowever, there is concern that providing both accountancy and auditing services creates a conflict of interest.\n\nUnder the new rules, large companies would be required to use smaller auditing firms to conduct part of their annual audit, in an attempt to dilute the Big Four's dominance.\n\nThe new proposals would require KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY to make their audits more rigorous.\n\nThey could face a cap on the number of companies on the FTSE 350 index they may audit, if those improvements don't go far enough.\n\nThe government said last year almost a third of audits inspected on the FTSE 350 were in need of improvement.\n\nThe largest private companies in the UK would also face greater scrutiny from regulators under the new rules.\n\nThe collapse of construction giant Carillion shed a light on failings in the audit profession.\n\nSir Donald Brydon, a former chairman of the London Stock Exchange who authored a government review on improving corporate governance, said the new proposals would help to \"restore trust\" and that similar measures had worked in the US.\n\n\"So many of us depend on business for our living and our life, whether it is suppliers, customers, employees or shareholders,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\n\"What really matters is that the information on which those people make their decisions is accurate and honest, and an auditor's role is to ensure as far as humanly possible, at a reasonable cost, that information is truthful.\"\n\nHe added: \"People want to know three things about a business - how is it performing, is it honestly run, and will it survive. And auditors are key to answering all three.\"\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Restoring business confidence, but also people's confidence in business, is crucial to repairing our economy and building back better from the pandemic.\n\n\"When big companies go bust, the effects are felt far and wide with job losses and the British taxpayer picking up the tab.\n\n\"It's clear from large-scale collapses like Thomas Cook, Carillion and BHS that Britain's audit regime needs to be modernised with a package of sensible, proportionate reforms.\"\n\nA new accountancy watchdog, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA), would be launched to implement the changes, replacing the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). It would have legal powers to force auditors and companies to resubmit their accounts without the need for court action.\n\nUK companies and directors also face curbs on dividend and bonus payments if there is misconduct, they publish inaccurate accounts, or have insufficient cash reserves. Directors of failed firms could also see their bonuses clawed back up to two years after a pay award is made, to clamp down on \"rewards for failure\", the government added.\n\nBy providing more transparency over company accounts the new rules should also help deter firms that could be facing insolvency from making largescale dividend and bonus payments. They will also be required to produce \"resilience statements\".\n\nAccountancy firms welcomed the proposals, with Jon Holt, head of audit at KPMG UK, saying: \"It is an ambitious package of strategic reform. Prioritising and clarifying the audit reform agenda is an important step to rebuild trust in the profession.\"\n\nKevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner at PwC UK, also stressed that importance of \"driving trust and confidence\" in the profession.\n\n\"We welcome comprehensive consultation. For lasting change, we need a coherent set of measures and for all parties to play their part. Listening to the views of a wide range of businesses, investors and other interested parties will be key to achieving this,\" Mr Ellis said.\n\nThe proposals also won the support of employers' groups. The CBI saying the reforms would \"inject focus and momentum behind efforts to maintain the highest possible standards\".\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce said the changes would be a \"positive step\". But Suren Thiru, BCC head of economics, cautioned: \"Government and regulators must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences, including adding to the already onerous cost burden on firms and undermining the UK's global reputation as great place to do business.\"",

The group were on their way to a tournament in Thousand Oaks where Bryant had been set to coach.\n\nThe fatal crash prompted a global outpouring of support for the NBA star and his family as well as a number of lawsuits.\n\nMrs Bryant has also sued the estate of the pilot, Mr Zobayan, and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and wrongful death. Families of the other victims sued the helicopter companies, but not Mr Zobayan's estate.\n\nCalifornia now has a state law prohibiting first responders from taking unauthorised pictures of people who died at the scene of an accident or crime.",

The nature of the sounds says something about the physical properties of the surface - how hard or how soft the rocks are, for example.\n\nThe newly released recording was made during a 27m drive by Perseverance on 7 March. The media at the top of this page is an abridged version of a sequence that runs for 16 minutes in raw form.\n\nSounds come across a little differently on Mars compared with Earth, due to the much reduced air pressure and contrasting composition. The sounds can seem somewhat muffled. The noise from the wheels is certainly loud, though.\n\nIn amongst the clatter, engineers say they can hear a kind of scratching noise, the source of which they are still trying to identify.\n\nThey are not sure if this is electromagnetic interference from one of the rover's electronics boxes or just another aspect of the general rattle that is produced in the interaction between the robot's mobility system and the surface.\n\nEngineers have been trying to identify a location to fly the helicopter\n\nPerseverance landed in Mars' Jezero Crater on 18 February. Most of its time since has been spent testing all its systems, tools and instruments.\n\nAn immediate goal is a helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth.\n\nThe vehicle is looking for a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device, called Ingenuity, can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly.\n\nNasa says engineers have now identified a likely location which they will discuss in more detail in a briefing on Tuesday next week.\n\nThe team behind Ingenuity will be given 30 Martian days, or sols (31 Earth days), to conduct up to five test flights.\n\nOnce complete, the main mission can begin. Perseverance is on Mars to search for signs of past life and to collect rocks that can be sent back to Earth later this decade.\n\nAn early destination for the robot will be the remains of a delta - a structure built up from the silt and sand dumped by a river as it enters a wider body of water.\n\nIn Jezero's case, this wider body was very likely a crater-wide lake that existed billions of years ago.",

            "content": "The French capital is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as the country fears a third wave.\n\nSome 21 million people in 16 areas of France will be placed under the measures from midnight on Friday.\n\nThese measures will not be as strict as the previous lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, with people allowed to exercise outdoors.\n\nFrance has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours.\n\nMr Castex said a \"third wave\" of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely.\n\nThe situation in Paris is particularly worrying with 1,200 people in intensive care there, more than at the peak of the second wave in November, Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said.\n\nUnder the new measures, non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but schools will remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a \"particular sanitary protocol\".\n\nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Attal stressed there would be differences with the two earlier lockdowns and said further details would be given of which business could stay open or would have to shut.\n\nPeople will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home and are not allowed to travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. Those in the affected areas will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes.\n\nThere is a weary resignation about Paris, as people prepare for another four weeks of tedium. Yes, we know this third lockdown won't be quite as bad as the second - which was itself a lighter version of the first. But still.\n\nAnother month of bits of paper for the police; another month of having to justify a trip to the supermarket; another month without meaningful social contact. It's enough to drive you to distraction.\n\nFrance's SNCF train company reported a surge in bookings ahead of the new lockdown\n\nExcept it hasn't. In general, most Parisians simply knuckle under. Those who can are leaving by train or car, but because schools are staying open, most families will stick it out in the city.\n\nEveryone's made the calculation. The long Easter weekend in two weeks is a bust. But the Paris school holidays start on 17 April - exactly when the lockdown is supposed to end.\n\nThat's the light that will keep people going. Spring break.\n\nAs well as the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France, Seine-Maritime and Eure areas will go under lockdown as well as the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera.\n\nFrance's nationwide curfew will remain in place. However, it will begin an hour later at 19:00 (18:00 GMT), taking into account the longer hours of daylight.\n\nFears of a third wave come as the French government faces criticism for its slow vaccine rollout.\n\nFrom Friday, France will resume vaccinating using the AstraZeneca jab following the EMA's announcement that it was fit for use. Mr Castex said he would be getting the vaccine straight away to prove that it was OK.\n\nFrance had suspended the jab after a number of people in Europe reported blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered.\n\nA survey conducted just as the suspension was announced found that only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca.",

            "content": "A court in Egypt has sentenced the prominent human rights activist Sanaa Seif to 18 months in jail after finding her guilty of \"spreading false news\".\n\nSeif was detained in June as she tried to file a complaint about an assault that she had allegedly suffered.\n\nProsecutors later accused her of making unfounded claims about the handling of Covid-19 outbreaks in Egyptian prisons.\n\nAmnesty International said she had been convicted \"on bogus charges stemming purely from her peaceful criticism\".\n\nPresident Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since leading the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013 following protests against his rule.\n\nSanaa Seif is the daughter of the late human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif al-Islam and the Cairo University professor and veteran activist Laila Soueif. Her brother is Alaa Abdel Fattah, an influential blogger and activist who has been imprisoned since September 2019.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who had already been jailed in connection with two other cases since 2014, was detained on 23 June outside the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cairo. She had been trying to report a physical assault the day before, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe rights group said Sanaa Seif had been waiting outside the Tora prison complex for a letter from her brother along with her mother and her sister Mona when a group of women beat them with sticks and stole some of their belongings. One police officer reportedly pushed her mother towards the assailants, it added.\n\nProsecutors subsequently accused Sanaa Seif of disseminating \"false news on the deterioration of the country's health situation, and the spread of the coronavirus in prisons\", as well as \"misusing social media\" and insulting a police officer.\n\nAfter Covid-19 reached Egypt, she accused prison authorities of mishandling outbreaks. Human Rights Watch documented several suspected outbreaks at prisons and police stations between last March and July, during which time it believes at least 14 prisoners died of Covid-19 complications.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mona Seif said her sister had been convicted and sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.\n\n\"Sisi's Egypt is a nightmare. He is intent on wasting their lives and health in prison #FreeSanaa #FreeAlaa,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\nLast week, the US and 30 other countries issued a joint declaration expressing deep concern about the human rights situation in Egypt.\n\nIt highlighted \"restrictions on freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, the constrained space for civil society and political opposition, and the application of terrorism legislation against peaceful critics\".\n\nThe Egyptian foreign ministry said it completely rejected the statement, which it said was astonishing and included \"claims based on inaccurate information\".",

            "content": "More pupils will be returning to classrooms over the next few weeks\n\nSupport in schools needs to be targeted to avoid trying to get children to \"catch up on everything\" when classes resume, according to researchers.\n\nSchools are yet to know the impact of months away from face-to-face teaching.\n\nCardiff University researcher Catherine Foster said children from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to have fallen behind while learning from home.\n\nThe Welsh government said the equivalent of about 2,000 extra full-time teaching staff had been hired.\n\nBut opposition parties have said classroom return plans lack detail.\n\nPrimary school children and some secondary pupils have returned to school after learning from home since before Christmas, but pupils will not all be back in class full time until 12 April.\n\nOn top of the face-to-face teaching missed this term, pupils also had to learn at home from March to July last year and many spent periods having to isolate, even when they were allowed back in class.\n\nDr Foster is part of a team at the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data which has surveyed young people in years 7 to 12 about their home learning experiences.\n\nShe said international research suggested children had fallen behind in terms of educational attainment and \"the progress lost is even worse for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds\".\n\nResearch suggested many children would not have engaged with their school work and motivation could be a problem when they are back in class, but experiences would differ, she added.\n\n\"Everyone has lost something - it varies a lot. But if there's a focus on catching up and trying to say 'well you've got to catch-up on everything you've missed, plus the work you've got to do this year', it's not going to help\", she said\n\n\"There's a lot of logic in saying that maybe we should just be identifying what young people need to progress and focusing on filling in those particular gaps, rather than trying to chuck everything at them and expecting them to do two years in one.\"\n\nAt Ysgol y Ddraig in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, the school believes that working towards the core aims of Wales' new curriculum will help with addressing the effects of the pandemic on children.\n\nBut executive head teacher Ty Golding thinks talk of \"catching-up\" is not helpful.\n\nHe said: \"I think we're trying to avoid the term catch-up if I'm honest, because it does suggest that learning is a linear process by which if children miss a chunk of work they'll never be able to engage in that level of learning.\n\n\"Really for us at the moment it's about the social reconnection, it's about getting the children back into routines\".\n\nAt Ysgol Glan Morfa in Cardiff, Gethin Bickerton has been employed as a teaching assistant since autumn 2020, one of hundreds of extra staff employed through the Welsh government's Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards programme.\n\nBefore the pandemic, he was an actor travelling around schools helping children learn about figures from Welsh history.\n\nNow he uses those skills to do role play with children to improve communication and help small groups with their reading.\n\n\"We have a mixture of pupils here. We have some who have engaged really well with online learning and those who can really engage with the work, but then we have the polar opposite,\" he said.\n\nMr Bickerton works with young children in the foundation phase where improving literacy is a key priority.\n\n\"The main focus at the moment is getting them back into some sort of routine and getting them back socialising with other people through the medium of Welsh - that's our main aim.\n\n\"But also going back to basics with some individuals as well, learning letters, words and forming sentences.\"\n\nLast summer, the Welsh government announced \u00a329m to fund 900 extra teaching staff, followed by a further \u00a372m investment announced earlier this month.\n\nIt said it had outstripped the recruitment target and so far the equivalent of around 2,000 extra full time staff had been employed.\n\nNew figures from the government showed that included 472 new full time teaching assistants and 248 new full time teachers, as well as hundreds of part time appointments and existing staff taking on extra hours.\n\nA spokesman said an evaluation of recruitment through Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards would be commissioned this year.\n\nHe added: \"Initial data suggests the funding has supported the recruitment of mostly new, rather than existing, staff.\n\n\"1,508 new full-time equivalent posts have been recruited to, compared to 487 (FTE) posts created from increased hours for existing staff.\"\n\nBut opposition parties have said the plans failed to provide a longer-term vision.\n\nThe Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said without a detailed roadmap for education recovery \"nobody's sure of how it will be spent and whether it will be spent effectively\".\n\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said a recovery plan needed to be part of \"an ambitious plan to invest in teaching\" in the long term.\n\n\"What we're hearing from the government is yet more announcements about funding but no plan about how that funding is going to be used.\"",

Government has got to make sure it doesn't happen.\"\n\nMr Miliband added it was a demonstration of the need for a comprehensive industrial strategy; a strategy he accused the government of abandoning with the recent abolition of the industrial strategy council of senior business leaders.\n\n\"We absolutely need an industrial strategy. Because we face such massive challenges as a country like the green transition, we have to undertake. And we can only do that without proper partnership between public and private sectors. Now, that does mean a clear roadmap, government showing the direction which is going, it also means public finance.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Times, the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, hinted that the government could intervene in the Liberty Steel crisis.\n\n\"We have done in the past. I think Liberty Steel is consonant with our decarbonisation agenda. I think it's a fundamentally good product... I can't anticipate or guarantee forms of intervention.\n\n\"The management has their own plan as well and I've got to see how that works out.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the government announced a plan to cut industrial carbon emissions by two-thirds by 2035 - allocating a billion pounds of money announced in the government's ten point plan to hit net zero by 2050.\n\nIts strategy for fostering private investment in offshore wind is a roaring success and we have just witnessed the largest state intervention in the private sector outside of wartime.\n\nI asked Mr Milliband whether the Labour Party had been outflanked on green investment and state intervention? He unsurprisingly disagreed.\n\n\"We're generating the offshore wind here but we're not manufacturing many turbines here, the world leader is Denmark. Why are they the world leader, because they have a proper industrial strategy, where government is willing to put its might alongside the private sector behind it.\n\n\"Businesses are deeply frustrated, angry even, that the government has torn up the work that was being done on an industrial strategy. If the government doesn't want to have one, we'll have one. Because we know we've got to work with business on the challenges we face.\"\n\nHe insisted that the people who presided over the last ten years were unlikely to be able to deliver transformation over the next ten years - and Britain was falling behind the US, France and Germany on investment.\n\nMany businesses do indeed say they liked the old industrial strategy - the sector deals that made them feel the government was holding their hand while setting big policy targets. Some feel we have destinations but no detailed map. But it is also true that the government has a trump card to play in this debate - and we can expect them to play it often.\n\nMinisters and officials point to the vaccine response as an exemplar of how the public and private sector can work together successfully. They also use it as an example of how a government freed from the meeting rooms of Brussels can be nimble when required.\n\nWhen asked what the UK will do with its supposed new found freedoms, insiders will find it difficult to make a list but would point to the vaccine success of \"knowing it when you see it\".\n\nThat argument works less well of course on the government's PPE procurement and the eye watering sums poured into test and trace.\n\nThe government insists it does have an industrial strategy - it just doesn't want to call it that. It prefers a \"plan for growth\", \"build back better\" - and it prefers its run by Number 10 and the Treasury rather than the Department for Business. It also says it is monitoring the Liberty Steel situation very closely.\n\nLabour's dilemma perhaps is that it has never had to fight against a conservative party in a situation like this. Unprecedented intervention in the private sector, running a huge budget deficit and choosing to pay for some of it with a whopping hike in business taxes in 2023.\n\nIt's been a strange year for everyone.",

One of these was fatal.\n\nThe EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT.\n\nCSVT can occur naturally and no link to the vaccine has been established. The patients also had low blood platelet counts - cells involved with clotting.\n\nCovid infection can make clots more likely.\n\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said regulators would continue to closely monitor the situation and people should have the vaccine when it is their turn: \"The public can have every confidence in the thoroughness of our review.\"\n\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the gains from getting vaccinated were clear.\n\n\"Given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these events, the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with the latest data suggesting an 80% reduction in hospitalisation and death from Covid disease, far outweigh any possible risks,\" he said.\n\nProduct information on the vaccine will be updated to include information about rare blood clots.\n\nEMA executive director, Emer Cooke, said: \"Drawing attention to these possible rare conditions and providing information to health care professionals and vaccinated people will help to spot and mitigate any possible side effects.\"\n\nThe EMA review, based on data from around 20 million people vaccinated, concluded:\n\nIt said any of the following symptoms after vaccination should prompt a medical check as a precaution:\n\nThese occur very rarely and are different to the common side-effects people can expect with any vaccine, such as some tenderness where the injection was given.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

I can't get my head around it.\n\n\"Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me.\"\n\nIn February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\n\"All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,\" he said.\n\nMr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge.\n\nThe TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death.\n\nSpeaking last year, he said: \"I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest.\n\nAn inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict.\n\nThree years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest.\n\nIn 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later.\n\nLast year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

But accessing this additional level of detail for journalistic purposes is unlawful.\n\nMr Hanks said: \"Pretty much everything I found out they could find out themselves using legal means - with the exception of the social security numbers.\n\n\"When you have that information\u2026 it's the key to the kingdom.\"\n\nWhile there is no evidence it happened in this instance, social security numbers in particular could potentially be used to further other intrusive investigations.\n\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex feel that today is an important moment of reflection for the media industry and society at large, as this investigative report shows that the predatory practices of days past are still ongoing, reaping irreversible damage for families and relationships.\n\n\"They are grateful to those working in media who stand for upholding the values of journalism, which are needed now more than ever before.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan recently took part in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey\n\nThe duke and duchess have had a fraught relationship with the UK's tabloid press. During the couple's recent interview with Oprah Winfrey, they said this had created a \"toxic environment\" of \"control and fear\" and was largely to blame for them leaving the UK.\n\nPrince Harry is currently suing the publisher of the Sun, and the former publisher of the Daily Mirror, over allegations of phone hacking before 2011.\n\nSeveral stories appeared in the Sun, and other newspapers, at the beginning of the couple's relationship. They included an article claiming Prince Harry had \"bombarded\" his future wife with text messages and another detailing a weekend they spent together at Meghan's home in Toronto.\n\nDanno Hanks worked as a private investigator in the US for over 40 years gathering information on celebrities and high-profile people including Michael Jackson and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHe achieved some notoriety in the 1990s via appearances on daytime television and has been jailed four times, most recently in 2017 for extortion.\n\nMr Hanks said he had provided reports for most of the British tabloid newspapers.\n\nHe said the Sun wrote to him after the Leveson Inquiry into press standards and asked him to sign documents, seen by the BBC, committing to act within the law and he repeated this assurance when he billed the Sun for his work.\n\nBut he claims no-one ever asked where he got his information. \"They didn't care. They just wanted the information,\" he said.\n\nMr Hanks came forward after being approached by Graham Johnson, a freelance journalist and editor of Byline Investigates, which publishes stories on the British media.\n\nMr Johnson, a former investigations editor at the Sunday Mirror, pleaded guilty to two counts of phone hacking in 2013.\n\nHis website has received money from prominent supporters of press reform, including actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, who were both victims of phone hacking, and his partner Emma Jones is on the board of Hacked Off, the press reform campaign group.\n\nMr Johnson, who paid Mr Hanks for access to his documents, said: \"This story definitely sticks out in the post-Leveson world because it has taken place five years after we thought these practices had stopped.\"\n\nMost victims of phone-hacking have settled their claims. Prince Harry hasn't. That's the vital context of this story.\n\nIn the course of nearly a year reporting on the complex, often fraught relationship between the monarchy and the media, it's become clear that he is, in an important sense, the last man standing among those victims.\n\nA News UK source told me that it was a \"huge priority\" and \"preoccupation\" for the company to repair relations with the royals after the severe damage done by the hacking revelations.\n\nBut the revelation that the Sun paid a private investigator to supply information on Meghan and her family, and that too in the period leading up to Prince Harry's bombshell public statement of 8 November 2016 in which he said a line had been crossed, will not improve relations.\n\nPrince Harry has been advised by many people both to make peace with Britain's tabloids, and to settle his claims against them. He hasn't. He may strike some journalists as an unlikely champion of press reform. But it is a role he seems keen on.\n\nMr Hanks, who has now retired, said watching Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah had also prompted him to speak out.\n\n\"I'm just doing it to clear my conscience,\" he said.\n\nAsked what he would say to Meghan and Harry directly, he said: \"I'm deeply sorry for what I did... and I'm available if your lawyers need to talk to me. I'm ready to give you what I know. Supply you with any information. I just wish this had never happened.\"\n\nIn a statement, News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun - said: \"In 2016, the Sun made a legitimate request of Mr Hanks to research contact details and addresses for Meghan Markle and possible relatives using legal databases which he had a license to use. He was paid $250.\n\n\"Mr Hanks was not tasked to do anything illegal or breach any privacy laws - indeed he was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully and he signed a legal undertaking that he would do so.\n\n\"The information he provided could not and did not raise any concerns that he had used illegal practices to obtain the information.\n\n\"At no time did the Sun request the social security number of Meghan Markle, nor use the information he provided for any unlawful practice.\n\n\"The Sun abides by all laws and regulations and maintains strict protocols in relation to the obtaining of information from third parties. Strict compliance is in place to cover all our reporting.\"",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "Nasa has carried out a successful test on part of the most powerful rocket in existence - the Space Launch System (SLS).\n\nEngines on the rocket's \"core stage\" were kept running for more than eight minutes - simulating the time it takes the SLS to go from the ground to space.\n\nIt's the second such test for the biggest segment of the SLS, after an attempt in January shut down early.\n\nThe SLS is to send humans to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972.\n\nThe mission is part of Nasa's Artemis project, launched by the Trump administration in 2017.\n\nThe launcher consists of the orange core, with its four powerful RS-25 engines, and two boosters attached to the sides.\n\nThe test at Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis, Mississippi, began at 16:37 ET (20:37 GMT). The core was attached to a giant structure called the B-2 test stand.\n\nA massive plume of exhaust expanded from the stand as the engines shook the ground. The cloud was so enormous, it was spotted from space by the Goes-16 satellite.\n\nAlthough the target was to fire the engines for eight minutes, teams from Nasa and prime contractor Boeing only had to keep them on for 250 seconds (four minutes) in order to gather all the engineering data they needed.\n\n\"It was a great day and a great test,\" said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk.\n\nThe chair of the US House Committee on Science, Space and Technology congratulated Nasa on the successful test. Texas democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson said: \"Achieving this significant milestone is a story of tenacity and dedication.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today's successful test brings us one step closer to returning American astronauts to the Moon in preparation for the human exploration of Mars.\"\n\nThe core that was part of Thursday's test will be used for the maiden flight of the SLS - currently scheduled for late 2021.\n\nIn the 1960s, the stand tested engines used in the massive Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo astronauts to the Moon.\n\nJohn Shannon, Boeing's vice president and program manager for the SLS, told me before the first hotfire attempt: \"When the engines start and then throttle up, we will do what's called a gimbal profile at 60 seconds. The engine nozzles move in a pre-programmed set of movements.\"\n\nThis gimbal movement of the nozzles allows the rocket to be steered during flight.\n\n\"This is the most heavily instrumented vehicle we will ever fly so we will get a tremendous amount of engineering data on vibration and temperature and stress, acoustics,\" said Mr Shannon.\n\nBefore Thursday's hotfire, engineers filled the core stage with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of propellant.\n\nThat propellant consisted of liquid hydrogen, which is the rocket's fuel, and liquid oxygen, which helps the fuel burn. They react explosively inside the engines, generating super-heated water vapour from the exhaust.\n\nWhen they're fed to the engines, the propellants are at more than two hundred degrees below zero (F), but the exhaust that emerges is 6,000F (3,316C) - hot enough to boil iron.\n\nHundreds of thousands of gallons of water were directed into the flame bucket to cool the exhaust. In addition, tens of thousands of gallons were used to create a water \"curtain\" around the engines to suppress the noise generated when they fire for eight minutes.\n\nThis was done to protect the core stage from vibrations while it is anchored to the stand.\n\nThe RS-25s, built by California-based Aerojet Rocketdyne, are the same ones that powered the space shuttle.\n\nThe engines tested on Thursday contributed to 21 successful shuttle flights over the vehicle's 30-year operational history.\n\nTwo were used on the last space shuttle mission, STS-135 in 2011. One flew on the 1998 mission that launched the oldest person ever to go to space - US senator and Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time. The other was used on one of the flights to service the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe engines were refurbished following shuttle missions, but they will be discarded after the maiden flight of the SLS later this year.\n\nThat mission, called Artemis-1, will send Nasa's next-generation crew vehicle, Orion, around the Moon to thoroughly test its systems.\n\nTom Whitmeyer, from Exploration Systems Development at Nasa, said it would take about a month to refurbish the core stage, after which it would be put on a ship to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare it for launch.\n\nHere, it will be installed on a structure called the mobile launcher between the two booster rockets, completing the SLS vehicle.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "The government is to cut grants aimed at encouraging people to buy electric vehicles in a move that has been criticised by the motor industry.\n\nThe Department for Transport will reduce the grant from \u00a33,000 to \u00a32,500 and restrict it to cars under \u00a335,000.\n\nBut Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it is \"the wrong move at the wrong time\".\n\nIt said the decision goes against the government's zero emissions ambitions.\n\n\"This sends the wrong message to the consumer, especially private customers, and to an industry challenged to meet the government's ambition to be a world leader in the transition to zero emission mobility,\" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.\n\nFord of Britain said the grant cut was \"disappointing and is not conducive to supporting the zero emissions future we all desire.\"\n\n\"Robust incentives - both purchase and usage incentives - that are consistent over time are essential if we are to encourage consumers to adopt new technologies,\" the carmaker's chairman Graham Hoare said.\n\nBusiness group the CBI also criticised the move, saying \"this is the wrong time to stunt a green recovery by making a sudden change to the grants on offer.\"\n\nMatthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said \"we must avoid sending mixed messages to consumers and businesses.\"\n\n\"Switching to an electric vehicle still has many barriers, including high upfront costs and availability of reliable charging points.\n\n\"A clear and consistent pathway for incentives will ensure business can continue to deliver the government's ambitions for reducing transport emissions,\" Mr Fell added.\n\nThe government said that higher-priced vehicles are typically bought by drivers who can afford to switch to electric vehicles without a subsidy.\n\nIt said the changes will allow funding for the grant to go further.\n\nTransport minister Rachel Maclean said: \"We want as many people as possible to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles.\"\n\n\"The increasing choice of new vehicles, growing demand from customers, and rapidly rising number of chargepoints means that while the level of funding remains as high as ever, given soaring demand, we are re-focusing our vehicle grants on the more affordable zero emission vehicles.\"\n\nThe government will also alter how it calculates the plug-in van grant, and change the eligibility for the grant to vehicles that are able to travel for 60 miles without any emissions.\n\nThe plug-in car grant was introduced a decade ago, and was designed to reduce the price of electric cars, which generally cost more to make than petrol or diesel equivalents, to encourage more people to buy them.\n\nElectric cars are expensive to make and expensive to buy compared with traditional vehicles.\n\nThe grant was introduced to reduce the price difference between electric models and conventional cars, to encourage people to buy them.\n\nThe government's argument is that now battery prices are falling, and with a range of cheaper cars coming onto the market, the size and scope of the grant can be reined in, and the available money can be better spent.\n\nThe market has certainly changed since the grant was introduced a decade ago. Electric car sales are now rising rapidly and relatively affordable vehicles with a practical range are becoming much more common.\n\nWith the government now planning to ban the sale of new non-hybrid petrol and diesel cars from 2030, it seems to be relying less on incentives and more on compulsion to bring about change.\n\nLess carrot and more stick.\n\nBut the industry believes this approach is wrong and that reducing the grant threatens to choke off the growth in electric car use, at a time when many other countries are offering much bigger subsidies.\n\nSince 2018, the government has been narrowing the scope of the grant, bringing the level down in stages from \u00a35,000 and tightening the eligibility criteria.\n\nIt said in 2018 that it wanted to gradually get rid of the grants. In March 2020, it extended the grant schemes for three years with \u00a3582m funding.\n\nSales of electric cars have increased rapidly over the past year, but remain a relatively small proportion of all cars sold.\n\nThe government says that by 2030 it wants to ban the sale of new cars powered only by petrol or diesel engines.\n\nAs part of a plan to make the UK carbon neutral, it unveiled a \u00a32.8bn package to support the switch to greener cars, including \u00a31.3bn for charging infrastructure.\n\nBut in February, the Policy Exchange think tank said the rollout of charging points had fallen behind what was needed to meet the planned ban on diesel and petrol cars.\n\nIt said there was a risk of \"charging blackspots\" in small towns and rural areas unless the rollout speeds up.\n\nPrice comparison site Carwow said cutting the subsidy for electric vehicles was a \"strange direction\" for the UK to take.\n\n\"For the most part, electric vehicle variants still carry a notable price premium versus traditional petrol or diesel variants,\" said Sepi Arani, commercial lead at Carwow.\n\n\"The lowering of the cap to \u00a335,000 limits the support to a much smaller proportion of cars, which in turn will no doubt have an effect on the UK's electric vehicle adoption.\n\n\"It's difficult to see why the grant scheme does not instead work on a tapered scheme, where the amount offered is staggered for different price points instead,\" Mr Arani added.",

Some may wish to continue online and or drive-in services for the time being due to their own local situation.\"\n\nThe bishops also noted the \"strong working relationship\" between the four churches.\n\nCatholic bishops in Northern Ireland emphasised the need for \"continued caution\" and a \"rigorous application of all mitigations and safeguards required\" to ensure a safe return to Mass on 26 March.\n\nThey said public worship would only be after a \"thorough risk assessment\", which means some parishes may decide to delay reopening for worshippers \"until a later date\".\n\nAnnouncing relaxations to coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday, First Minister Arlene Foster said she and the deputy first minister had spoken with Church leaders about their desire to resume public worship.\n\nMrs Foster has defended the pathway out of lockdown, which has been criticised by some business leaders for its lack of dates.\n\nSpeaking at the assembly, she said: \"We need to continue to acknowledge how much people need hope and solace... we acknowledge the risk involved and the mitigations required by the churches.\n\n\"Some places of worship will find it easier to continue with online services, of course.

            "content": "BT's Openreach to build full-fibre internet 'like fury' after Ofcom move\n\nBT has said it will \"build like fury\" to roll out full-fibre internet connections after new rules announced by the UK's telecoms regulator.\n\nOfcom has decided not to impose price caps on full-fibre connections provided by the firm's Openreach subsidiary.\n\nThis gives the company the certainty it had been looking for ahead of a planned \u00a312bn investment.\n\nHowever, the decision lays Ofcom open to criticism that is has given a near-monopoly operator a generous deal.\n\nThat could mean more expensive internet connections for the public than might have been the case.\n\nOfcom also froze the price curbs it levels on what Openreach charges internet service providers for its slower copper-based connections.\n\nOpenreach lays down and maintains the fibre-optic cables involved as well as operating the associated telephone exchanges, and then sells use of these services to individual internet service providers. They in turn sell access to the public.\n\nThe business has said it can now confirm a plan to build fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) connections to 20 million homes and offices by the mid- to late-2020s.\n\n\"Today's regulation will allow us to ramp up to three million premises per year providing vital next generation connectivity for homes and business right across the UK,\" said Openreach's chief executive Clive Selley.\n\n\"It's true we certainly want to make sure that BT can have a fair bet on this investment, but at the core of our approach is that we are trying to get competition into the wholesale network layer, of broadband for the future, really for the first time in quite a new way,\" Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.\n\n\"And the reason we believe in competition is we actually think that's best for the consumer. It gives us all more options to choose from, not just on pricing but also on service quality and reliability.\"\n\nAs part of the measures, Ofcom will effectively freeze the wholesale fees Openreach charges for providing \"superfast\" data speeds of up to 40 megabits per second, which rely on copper links via fibre to the cabinet (FTTC) or older technologies.\n\nThe watchdog had previously forced these to fall by about 20% over recent years.\n\nThe price Openreach charges for faster and more reliable FTTP connections will remain unregulated.\n\nThere is, however, one new restriction.\n\nOpenreach will not be allowed to offer geographic discounts on its full-fibre wholesale services. A similar limitation already existed on its provision of \"superfast\" links.\n\nAnd Ofcom has said it will review all long-term discount arrangements offered by Openreach to its clients, and will intervene if necessary to prevent the firm from stifling investment by rivals.\n\nIt said it believed its approach should mean about 70% of the UK would still end up with a choice of networks.\n\nVirgin Media, CityFibre and Hyperoptic are among alternative providers.\n\nTheir ability to profit from building rival networks would have come under pressure if they had been required to match new full-fibre price caps imposed on Openreach.\n\n\"Rolling out infrastructure is a costly and time-consuming venture, that comes with a long pay-back on investment,\" commented Kester Mann, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS Insight.\n\n\"This is particularly true in less-densely populated areas where the economics may be considerably less appealing.\n\n\"As such, Openreach needed certainty that it would be able to make a sufficient return on investment before embarking on the next stages of roll-out.\"\n\nOpenreach will also be allowed to turn off copper-based networks in areas where faster full-fibre internet connections to properties have already been deployed.\n\nThis should help reduce its costs by removing the need to maintain two different systems in parallel.\n\nOfcom said this would also help promote take-up of faster fibre services.\n\nHowever, it indicated that any such switch off must be done \"progressively... over a number of years\".\n\nAnd it added that customers would be \"protected\" during the transition to ensure they would continue to have access to the net.\n\nOfcom had to walk a difficult line with this review.\n\nIf it set regulation too tight by capping wholesale prices at a low level, the risk was that BT and its fibre network rivals would be reluctant to invest the billions needed to roll out ultrafast broadband.\n\nIf it loosened the reins it would be accused of going soft on BT, sparking anger from the likes of Sky, which use the Openreach network and would have to pass on the higher prices to their retail customers.\n\nBy opting to impose no price controls on BT's fibre product for a decade, Ofcom has chosen the second option, insisting that it is the only way to spark the frenzy of competitive network building needed to move the UK up into the broadband fast lane.\n\nWhat this review does not do is ensure ultrafast connections reach the 20% of the country where BT and its rivals still don't believe they can make a commercial return.\n\nThe broadband industry is waiting impatiently to hear how the government plans to spend the \u00a31.5bn of public money it has promised by 2025 to spur investment in rural fibre coverage. An announcement on that is expected imminently.",

            "content": "Covid-19: 'Surgeries must be protected' in any future wave\n\nCovid-free sites must be developed to protect surgeries in the event of another coronavirus wave, a leading consultant has said.\n\nMark Taylor, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Northern Ireland, said lessons must be learned from the past year.\n\n\"The conditions that need surgery don't go away because of Covid,\" he said.\n\nHis warning comes as the BBC learned an estimated 1,600 cancer patients have been missed because of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, a research body which helps inform decision-making, hundreds of people with serious cancers have yet to be diagnosed.\n\nThe Department of Health said every attempt had been made to protect the most urgent surgeries and to reschedule postponed operations as quickly as possible.\n\nThere were fewer cancellations during this latest surge than at the height of the first surge last March due to \"robust planning and prioritisation\" despite more service pressures, it added.\n\nAmong those patients adversely affected by the pandemic is Flo McClements.\n\nThe 72-year-old grandmother was diagnosed with an ovarian tumour last December.\n\nHer surgery was postponed for three weeks earlier this year and when it did happen, doctors found the cancer had spread.\n\nHer family have said they feel like \"collateral damage\" for the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas.\n\nDaughter-in-law Christine McClements told BBC News NI: \"It was awful. She is my mother-in-law and means everything to us.\n\nGregg McClements said the delay has been \"detrimental\" to his mother.\n\n\"The consultant had advised us we have gone from being able to cure my mum's cancer to now just being able to treat it and give her chemotherapy. Hopefully that might get it in remission, but there is no guarantee.\n\n\"So it is all devastating.\"\n\nAt his most recent appearance before a Stormont scrutiny committee, Health Minister Robin Swann said he wanted to see action to repair some of the damage Covid-19 had caused to the health service.\n\n\"I am keen that we scale up this high-priority surgery as quickly as possible,\" he told assembly members.\n\n\"This can be done by initially creating green pathways, as they have become known elsewhere.\n\n\"Eventually turning Belfast City Hospital into a green site which will serve the region.\"\n\nMark Regan, chief executive officer of the private Kingsbridge Hospital in Belfast, said the sector had provided an \"essential\" lifeline for the health service over the past year and maintaining that co-operation should be part of the solution.\n\nHe told BBC News NI that 1,754 surgeries had been performed on NHS patients and 13,267 CT, MRI and ultrasound scans carried out since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"The outcome is ultimately that patients that may not have been able to be seen within the NHS are now being treated in each of the three independent hospitals,\" he said.\n\n\"Those are patients that are time dependent, red flag, cancers and things that could progress and could have a bigger impact if left.\"\n\nDeirdre Heenan, professor of social policy at Ulster University, said finding a way forward would ultimately depend on \"long-term strategic planning\".\n\n\"It's not good enough to say we don't have the resources.\n\n\"It's up to the Department of Health to make sure they have those resources; buy in those resources from the private sector if that's what is required.\n\n\"If we look at NHS England - they have set out a recovery plan with targets which talks about workforce planning; realises there will have to be specialists within the workforce and they have set out how they are going to do that.\n\n\"We should expect the same.\"",

            "section": "Scotland",
            "content": "Scotland is to get 500,000 fewer vaccine doses over the next month due to UK supply issues.\n\nHowever, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country remains on track to meet its targets despite the shortfall.\n\nUK ministers have faced calls to explain why there would be a significant reduction in incoming vaccines from the end of March.\n\nIt is partly due to a delay in a delivery from India of five million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\n\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs: \"We expect that over the next month we will have approximately 500,000 fewer doses than we had previously anticipated.\n\n\"For that reason there may be periods in April where we need to prioritise second doses.\"\n\nSecond doses should be administered within 12 weeks of a first dose.\n\nMs Sturgeon added that the government still intends to offer first doses to all people in the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) top priority groups by mid-April.\n\nThis covers everyone aged over 50, unpaid carers and people with underlying health conditions.\n\nThe first minister said she \"still expects\" to offer a dose to all adults in the population by the end of July.\n\nShe added: \"We have always known that supplies will be subject to some volatility but the roll-out of the programme overall continues to be really encouraging and it does give us real cause for optimism now about the months ahead.\"\n\nEarlier, Scotland's national clinical director told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that targets should be met despite a \"significant reduction\" in UK vaccine supplies.\n\nProfessor Jason Leitch said ministers may have to think about \"who comes next and when they come next\" after April.\n\nHe added: \"We do not anticipate it will affect our second doses at all because we can prioritise them and just now they are mainly Pfizer.\"\n\nProf Leitch said there is no suggestion from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca that they will not be able to meet their end targets.\n\nThe national clinical director has made it clear that disruption to the vaccine supply will not affect two key targets.\n\nAll those over 50 or with underlying health conditions should still get their first jab by mid April, and the whole of the adult population should still be offered a jab by July.\n\nOne big question is when people in their 40s with no underlying health conditions - who may have been assuming they would be vaccinated in mid to late April - will now get their jab.\n\nAnother is whether disruption to the supply will have any effect on the easing of lockdown.\n\nAs the plan was to vaccinate over-50s by mid April and it takes three weeks for someone to get as much protection as one dose offers, it would seem unlikely that there will be any effect on the changes planned for 5 and 26 April.\n\nBut will progress be sufficient to allow other restrictions to ease in May and June as hoped?\n\nThe groups who will be vaccinated by mid-April account account for 99% of Covid deaths and the overwhelming majority of hospital admissions.\n\nBut with a growing amount of evidence that vaccination also reduces transmission, immunising younger people will also play a part in keeping case numbers down and providing even more protection to those most at risk.\n\nIt will be well worth watching the numbers in the coming weeks.\n\nThe UK government said neither a single factory nor a country was responsible for the expected slow down.\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that UK supplies would be lower \"than we might have hoped for in the coming weeks\", but this was expect to increase in April.\n\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the JCVI, said the supply issues meant efforts would focus on the first phase of the programme to vaccinate the over 50s.\n\nSecond doses for those immunised earlier in the year would also be prioritised\n\nThe Bristol University academic told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that phase two - to vaccinate the remaining adult population - would move forward when supplies were restored.\n\nProf Finn said: \"We have seen this in the past with other vaccines. Because they are biological agents rather than straightforward drugs they are more difficult to manufacture at scale.\n\n\"So we always try and make sure that we have got more than one supplier for vaccination against any particular disease.\"\n\nProf Finn said the issues should only result in a \"partial interruption\" to UK's vaccination programme and said it remains \"on track\".\n\nThe Scottish government said that \"appointments will be fulfilled\" for anyone already scheduled to have their first dose or second dose.\n\nA spokesman added: \"Supplies of the vaccine have dipped before and our vaccination programme will continue to manage the stock available to get vaccines into arms as fast as possible.\"\n\nOn Wednesday it was announced that more than two million people in Scotland had received their first dose of the vaccine.\n\nThe Scottish government said the milestone meant that 44% of the eligible population had been reached.\n\nLatest vaccination figures reveal 2,023,002 had received their first dose of the vaccine - an increase of 41,184 - as of 08:30 on Thursday.\n\nA total of 192,100 people have so far received a second dose of the vaccine, an increase of 10,221.",

            "content": "Alex Salmond inquiry affects more than just Nicola Sturgeon's future\n\nAs I write, nine members of the Scottish Parliament are still in a virtual meeting, discussing, voting, likely indeed arguing, over their conclusions on the future of the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nTheir inquiry is part of the machinations of a long running dispute between one of the most successful political duos this country has seen for decades, as the first minister and her predecessor, and very much former friend, have come to blows. Remind yourself what the very sorry saga is all about here.\n\nWhat we know from inside that committee room is that the MSPs have voted by a margin of one vote, 5-4, that Nicola Sturgeon misled them.\n\nBefore we see the final report, which may not come for a while, it's hard to know what caveats they have applied, precisely what the circumstances are that they describe. The details will matter.\n\nMs Sturgeon's team is already trying to dismiss the findings as a partisan attack, a predictable political play from a committee of MSPs, designed to damage the first minister, whose popularity they envy, who has been almost untouchable for so long.\n\nThe findings they really fear are from the separate Hamilton Inquiry, being carried out by an independent lawyer in to whether she broke the rules that govern ministers' behaviour.\n\nIf she's found to have done that, convention suggests she would have to resign.\n\nIt is clear that Nicola Sturgeon has no intention of giving into opposition demands out there to get her to quit on the basis of the MSPs' conclusions.\n\nOf course this is intensely political, it's not just about who said what, when and where.\n\nBut a public finding from a parliamentary committee that she misled them can't just be brushed away.\n\nIt's a serious accusation from a group of senior politicians after an investigation that looked at thousands of pages of evidence.\n\nIt's a huge distraction just before the official start of vital Scottish elections. It underlines the bitter lines drawn inside the SNP during this saga.\n\nAnd it's damaging to the reputation of one of the country's most important politicians, whose personal standing is key not just to what happens in Scotland, but what happens to the whole of the UK.\n\nThe SNP has been all powerful under Ms Sturgeon's leadership. And her personal profile has been a vital part of creating a powerful political sense, although importantly never a certainty, that another referendum on Scottish independence was somehow inevitable.\n\nIf the SNP clinches a majority in May, it's her intention to use that to claim a mandate for another ballot. (Remember, it is also the UK government's firm intention to say no, which is, as things stand, its legal right.)\n\nBut in turn, anything that tarnishes her, could damage the SNP's standing in those May elections.\n\nAnd anything that harms her credibility, chips away at the sometimes lazy political sentiment, that the events of the last few years have set Scotland firmly on a path out of the UK.\n\nThe arguments of a group of politicians won't settle all of this.\n\nBut what they decide is one part of the overall wrangle over the future of the union itself.",

But on the whole, especially when speaking to those working on the front line, it is not happening every week.\n\n\"If you are symptomatic, you do get tested. But for those without symptoms, it is not happening regularly.\"\n\n\"I think [BMA Cymru] members are angry. We are more than willing to put ourselves at risk of contracting Covid. But we speak to those working in the film industry or in schools and they are getting lateral flow tests.\n\n\"But then, those working for health boards aren't always getting them. When I talk to friends, they are shocked to hear that.\"\n\nWhen questioned at the Welsh government's Covid press conference on Wednesday, Mr Gething said he was unaware there was an issue.\n\nHe said: \"They should be available. In the information I've had, they're going out regularly across the service.\n\n\"I'm concerned, which is why I'd like to get the detail to be able to give you an answer and resolve the issue.\n\n\"The whole point of providing these lateral flow tests is they are part of what we can do to give people to give people that extra reassurance, to give us an extra tool in our armoury to make sure we understand where coronavirus is and to help people protect themselves and the people around them.\"\n\nWhen asked at a Welsh government press conference, the health minister said he was unaware of these concerns\n\nDr Samuel on behalf of BMA Cymru, \"It is concerning that the health minister doesn't seem to be aware what's happening at the coalface.\n\n\"Perhaps the government need to talk to health boards and understand why this testing isn't happening currently. If the government say they think it is happening, that isn't true.\"\n\nAt the health minister's request, Newyddion S4C supplied his office with further information so that he could offer a fuller response and address the issue.\n\nA spokesperson later issued a statement which said: \"We have supplied more than 1.5 million lateral flow tests to health boards and NHS trusts in Wales to support the delivery of asymptomatic workforce testing.\n\n\"We are also in the process of expanding the programme and providing supplies to primary care independent contractors and independent hospitals across Wales.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "The NHS in England was ill-prepared for the seismic shock of the Covid pandemic, a hospital chief has said.\n\nThe service was already running at nearly full capacity with long waits for non-urgent operations even before coronavirus arrived, according to Prof Marcel Levi, the University College London Hospitals trust's chief executive.\n\nProf Levi leaves his role at the end of March, after four years, to return to his native Holland to become chief scientific adviser to the Dutch government.\n\nIn a BBC interview, he argues that it could take \"a very long time\" to clear the backlog of routine surgery and procedures which has built up because of cancellations during the pandemic. He says more money will be needed quickly to run weekend and evening sessions in operating theatres.\n\nProf Levi also believes the most successful responses to the pandemic were those under the control of the NHS - in contrast to those which were run by independent contractors.\n\n\"If you want to get something done, ask the NHS and don't outsource it to all these private companies,\" he said.\n\nProf Levi started his job in London having been chairman of the executive board of the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nA magazine in the Netherlands named him as Dutchman of the year in 2016. He is a practising consultant, and continued seeing patients as well as carrying out his chief executive role.\n\nHe believes hospitals coped extremely well in the face of intense pressure when infection rates surged during the second wave in early 2021.\n\n\"I do not think there is any country with such a high number of Covid patients presenting with such a steep rise like we've seen in January and February, that were dealt with in any health system in such a proper way,\" he said.\n\n\"So I'm very proud of how the NHS behaved and acted with the skill available to provide sufficient hospital care for what patients needed.\"\n\nHowever, the first wave was a very different story. He says the NHS was not as robust as it should have been, a key factor being that the UK was one of the countries with the lowest number of intensive care beds per 1,000 of population.\n\n\"You cannot run a healthcare system at the capacity we run the NHS. We are always 95% full, so it's impossible to quickly respond to an emergency situation.\"\n\nEvery winter with influenza circulating there are peaks in demand, resulting in cancellations of operations because there is not enough intensive care space.\n\n\"We should have seen that and said this is just flu, what would happen if we had a real pandemic - and then we would probably have been better prepared.\"\n\nThe same argument applies to routine surgery and procedures: there were already long waiting lists even before the pandemic started.\n\nMore than 300,000 patients have waited more than a year in England, but Prof Levi points out they had waited a long time before Covid forced hospitals to postpone operations.\n\n\"Covid is actually a magnifying glass, making it clear that capacity in the NHS is not sufficient - that has now become very obvious. It's going to take, I am afraid, a very long time to get where we want to be.\"\n\nProf Levi's comments came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced \u00a36.6 billion extra for health and care in England in the first half of the 2021/22 financial year.\n\nMr Hancock told MPs the money was in addition to funding committed as part of the spending review to help the NHS meet additional Covid costs and starting work on the elective recovery.\n\nProf Levi's analysis makes sobering reading, because he has experience of other health systems, and has seen the front line in the UK with a fresh perspective.\n\nBut he also believes that the NHS has many strengths - and takes a swipe at the use of private contractors in some areas of the Covid response.\n\n\"Everything that has been a big success - addressing these massive peaks for patients needing intensive care and also vaccination - was the part done by the NHS.\n\n\"Everything that was actually not so successful - test-and-trace, PPE provision, all these things - was outsourced to companies which failed to deliver what they promised.\n\n\"That is a reminder for the future - the NHS is a very strong organisation. If you want to get something done ask the NHS and not outsource it to all these private companies.\"\n\nAnd the best thing about the NHS? The people who work in it, he said.\n\n\"The resilience and the quality and the camaraderie of people I have been working with - doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, cleaners, teamwork - that's something I have never encountered before.\"",

But in order to help ensure that you and your family members stay safe with Peloton products in your home, we need your help,\" he wrote in the letter to customers.\n\n\"Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.\"\n\nThe US Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was investigating the incident.\n\nPeloton sells cycling machines and treadmills that can be connected online to virtual fitness classes. Its business has boomed as people look for alternative ways to exercise during lockdowns and gym closures.\n\nThe firm has said the skyrocketing demand has created supply chain pressures, leading to backlogs in orders for the machines.\n\nIts treadmills, which sell for more than $2,400 (\u00a31,722), were designed for use by those aged 16 and older, who weigh at least 105 pounds, it said.\n\nMr Foley said the company did not intend to release more information about the accidents, in order to respect privacy of those involved.\n\n\"While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved,\" he wrote.\n\nThe company is \"currently assessing ways to reinforce our warnings about these critical safety precautions to hopefully prevent future accidents,\" he added.\n\nLast year, Peloton recalled about 27,000 bikes in the US, citing problems after clip-on pedals broke unexpectedly during use.\n\nThere were an estimated 22,500 treadmill-related injuries treated at US emergency departments among all ages, including around 2,000 involving children under the age of eight, according to the consumer product safety commission.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, it received reports of 17 deaths related to the use of a treadmill, including one involving a 5-year-old.",
