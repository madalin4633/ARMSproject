            "content": "Left-right: Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed are all nominated\n\nSacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars.\n\nVanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees.\n\nIt's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nAnd two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history.\n\nChloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman.\n\nOther nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman.\n\nMank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations.\n\nThis year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station.\n\nOlivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both nominated for The Father\n\nDaniel Kaluuya is nominated for playing Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nThe eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination.\n\nAt 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.\n\nColman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father.\n\nCarey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director.\n\nKirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively.\n\nOther British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\n\nSix black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017. This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song.\n\nDavis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever.\n\nWow! I'm honoured to be nominated by my fellow actors alongside such inspiring performances, and am grateful to the Academy for their support and encouragement. I\u2019m equally thrilled for our visionary writer-director Darius Marder and the brilliant Paul Raci... pic.twitter.com/Z6ScOq08tf \u2014 Riz Ahmed (@rizwanahmed) March 15, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter\n\nAhmed is the first actor of Pakistani descent to get an Oscar nomination and the first Muslim to be up for best actor; and Yuh-Jung Youn is the first South Korean actress to get an Oscar nod.\n\n\"Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!\" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor.\n\nMinari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.\n\nBoseman is nominated alongside Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - his final role before he died of cancer at the age of 43 last year.\n\nThe much-loved star, who is also known for his role in Black Panther, is the favourite to be given the best actor award.\n\nIf he does, he will be only the second posthumous best actor winner after Peter Finch for Network in 1976.\n\nOnly five women had been nominated for best director before, and only one has won - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010.\n\nThis year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van.\n\nZhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night.\n\nSo proud and grateful to every amazing person who worked on this film. Never going to stop crying. \u2014 Emerald Fennell (@emeraldfennell) March 15, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter\n\nFennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year.\n\nOverall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards.\n\nThe 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n\"I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,\" she said.\n\nHer previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year?\n\nProbably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel.\n\nPlus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.\n\nMank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture.\n\nCrucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script.\n\nIt has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited.\n\nMank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves.\n\nIt would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley.\n\nI have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you in the morning.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has warned against protests while Covid lockdown restrictions are in place, amid public anger over Sarah Everard's death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she said the case \"had rightly ignited anger\" and that she was committed to listening to women and girls, but urged people not to \"participate in large gatherings or protests\". She has started a review into policing of Saturday's vigil for Ms Everard - when police removed a number of women from the gathering on Clapham Common in south London.\n\nMore European countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, after a series of incidents in Europe involving blood clots. France, Italy and Germany are the latest to halt their rollouts, joining several smaller European nations. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is no evidence that the incidents are caused by the vaccine, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the UK continues \"to be very confident\" about its vaccine programme. It comes as a big increase in the number of people being offered Covid jabs in the UK is expected in the coming days, made possible by a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute in India. Our health correspondent Nick Triggle examines whether governments are being too cautious.\n\nCabinet ministers and senior officials have told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that Boris Johnson should have brought in tougher coronavirus restrictions in the early autumn to prevent more deaths. An investigation reveals significant frustration in government about the PM's unwillingness to tighten restrictions in September, as cases again began to rise. One senior figure says there was a \"sense of denial about the second wave\". Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended the decisions taken, saying the government had \"listened to all the evidence all the way through\".\n\nPopular pandemic items such as hand sanitiser, loungewear and hand weights - for gym-goers stuck at home - are now being used to calculate the cost of living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has also added smartwatches and electric cars to the annual review. But white chocolate and sandwiches bought at work are out. The ONS says it decided to add men's loungewear bottoms and women's sweatshirts to the basket of more than 700 goods, which is used to calculate inflation, to reflect a move towards more casual clothing.\n\nThe 63rd Grammy Awards were unlike any other, as socially-distanced music stars sat in a big, anonymous marquee outside the LA Convention Center. But when they were each allowed to briefly de-mask and hit the stage, they made it a night remember. BBC music reporter Mark Savage says the ceremony reflected a year of solitude and protest. You can read his full review here. Or take a look at these five weird and wonderful moments from the night, including Harry Styles' feather boa and Dua Lipa's musical workout.\n\nTaylor Swift at the 2021 Grammys: Stuck indoors like the rest of us\n\nYou can check out the latest data on vaccinations and find out who is eligible now.\n\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\n\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\n\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

            "content": "People aged 50 or over in Northern Ireland can now book their Covid-19 vaccine appointment, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.\n\nThose who are eligible and wish to receive the vaccine can booking it online or be contacted by their GPs.\n\nBooking slots are available at the seven regional vaccination centres.\n\nThere was some frustration about the length of time some people were having to wait in the queue to book their slot on Monday.\n\nHowever, Mr Swann told the assembly that in the first three hours of the slots opening 30,000 people had booked vaccines.\n\nThe centres will primarily be using the AstraZeneca vaccine for first doses, to maximise available vaccine supplies.\n\nAnyone who received the Pfizer vaccine as a first dose will still receive the Pfizer vaccine for their second dose.\n\nNorthern Ireland's health minister told the assembly that the \"benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks\".\n\nIt comes after health officials in Northern Ireland said they would continue to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after its suspension in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe temporary suspension of the vaccine is already having an impact on the republic's immunisation programme.\n\nAbout 30,000 vaccination appointments for health staff and those at high-risk might be delayed, according to RT\u00c9.\n\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly described its move as \"precautionary\", after reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway.\n\nAstraZeneca has said there is no evidence of a link between the vaccine and increased risk of clotting, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said it would continue to use the vaccine after receiving guidance from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nThe latest figures show that across Northern Ireland 629,461 people have now received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 54,636 have received two.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Health recorded a further 121 cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\n\nOne additional death was reported, bringing the department's total number of deaths with Covid-19 to 2,099.\n\nFor a second day in a row, no additional deaths were reported in the Republic of Ireland, where there have a total of 4,534 Covid-19-related deaths.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's health department said there were 575 more confirmed cases, which brings that total to 227,316.\n\nNorthern Ireland's health minister said vaccination was a \"bridge to better, safer and more normal times for everyone\".\n\nChief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the more people are vaccinated then \"the more we are all protected\".\n\nHe received his first jab on Monday morning.\n\nFull confidence in #AstraZenaca says CMO as he gets his jab #Covid_19 pic.twitter.com/T7uvQ05vNH \u2014 Marie-Louise Connolly - Look Forward. #FightBack (@mlchealth) March 15, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Protect yourself and others,\" he said.\n\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster also urged those eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine.\n\n\"The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) have been very clear that it is safe to take the AstraZeneca vaccine,\" said the DUP leader.\n\n\"I am looking forward to taking it, either this week or next week, depending on when I am able to get my vaccine booked for, but it is very important that people continue to take the vaccine.\"\n\nOn Monday, Dr Alan Stout, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) NI GP committee, said it was the large supply of AstraZeneca jab that allowed the vaccination programme to continue at the speed it is.\n\nHe advised people that it was safe to receive, and there was also a risk of blood clotting with things like long-haul air travel, the contraception pill, and some forms of surgery.\n\n\"These are world experts that we have in these regulators bodies and they are all saying the same thing, and they are all saying it is safe,\" he said.\n\nDr Stout said he was \"hopeful\" jabs would be offered to the over-40s age group by Easter, mirroring the situation reportedly happening elsewhere in the UK.\n\nWhile health officials in the Republic of Ireland are choosing to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, in Northern Ireland they're accelerating the programme. So who should we trust?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the vaccine is safe. That message has been reinforced by the British Medical Association.\n\nIt's hard to ignore that the MHRA has said that it has received a small number of reports of blood clots relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nBut it does seem that health officials in the Republic are being excessively cautious - Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and the country's deputy chief medical officer have said as much themselves.\n\nRelations between the EU and AstraZeneca are somewhat toxic at present with the Republic of Ireland, where the vaccine is reportedly in short supply, having been let down so many times on delivery of the vaccine.\n\nWhile people in the Republic will be rolling down their sleeves, in Northern Ireland an even greater number are preparing to roll them up.\n\nThe rollout will continue to be prioritised based on age, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, the Department of Health has said.\n\nVaccines are being dispensed in parallel by GP practices and vaccination centres.\n\nNorthern Ireland has seven regional vaccination centres: Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, South Lake Leisure Centre, Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Foyle Arena, Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre.\n\nPlans are also being finalised for community pharmacies to join the programme in the coming weeks, the department added.\n\nAn additional regional mass vaccination centre will open at the end of March at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\n\nThe vaccination centres are now offering bookings to:\n\nCarers who have not already booked a vaccination appointment can email their health trust carer co-ordinators and they will make the necessary arrangements.\n\nThe latter clinically vulnerable (CV) group is expected to largely mirror those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.\n\nCEV and CV individuals aged 16 and 17 years of age cannot receive the vaccine being used in GP practices.\n\nThese individuals will receive a letter from their GP and are able to book a vaccination slot at one of the vaccination centres.\n\nPeople who want to book a vaccination centre appointment are asked to do so online if it all possible.\n\nIf online booking is not possible, then the telephone booking number is 0300 200 7813.\n\nThe booking line is open 08:00 GMT until 20:00 Monday to Friday.",

Her death has prompted a debate over women's safety.\n\nA vigil on Saturday to remember the 33-year-old marketing executive has attracted criticism after footage showed officers detaining women, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say he was \"deeply concerned\".\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has dismissed calls to resign and defended the force's actions.\n\nWhen asked about clarity on gyms reopening, in light of safety concerns raised after Ms Everard's death, Ms Williams said women feeling unsafe exercising alone outdoors \"tells you how far we have got to go as a society\".\n\nBut she did not confirm when gyms may reopen in Wales.\n\nVigils were also held in Wales on Saturday night to mark Ms Everard's death - some were held online, others were attended in person.\n\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Monday, Ms Williams said anyone watching events unfold at the London vigil would have been \"shocked by what they saw\".\n\n\"But can I say how grateful I am to women and men in Wales who, over this weekend, also carried out vigils to mark the death of Sarah, and the wider issues that that death makes us confront as a society, and the police that oversaw those gatherings in a really respectful way.\"\n\nPam French has spoken to her two sons, aged three and six, about women's safety\n\nPam French, an organiser of a vigil for Ms Everard at Hailey Park in Llandaff North, said she had spoken about women's safety with her two sons, aged three and six.\n\n\"Sometimes it's easier to talk to children about it because the response isn't defensive, it's usually, 'why are you upset and what can I do about it?'.\n\n\"We've just been talking to them about being kind, treating people equally and all of those really basic messages, but if we start them from that early on then hopefully, we can make a difference,\" she said.\n\nThe 43-year-old said issues raised in the past week \"just rips sticky plasters off a lot of stuff that I think a lot of us have held for many years\".\n\n\"For many of us, that brought home years of having to change our behaviour and modify our behaviour and being afraid,\" she added.\n\nPeople attended a vigil in Llandaff North in Cardiff on Saturday\n\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\n\nHer remains were later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her kidnap and murder.\n\nFollowing Ms Everard's death, several hotels in Cardiff have responded by offering help to anyone feeling unsafe.\n\nAbout 50 people attended the vigil in Llandaff North\n\nThe Angel Hotel urged women walking home who felt afraid to come to its reception.\n\nIt tweeted: \"In light of the devastating news regarding Sarah Everard this week, here at the Angel Hotel we would like to offer women and girls who feel intimidated, scared or at risk in Cardiff city centre a 'safe place'.\n\n\"Please come into our reception and a member of our team will help you call a taxi, friend or family member to ensure you get home safe.\"\n\nLater, the city's Indigo Hotel said it had been inspired by the Angel Hotel's offer and tweeted that staff would \"help you and ensure that you get home safely\".\n\nSophie Howe said there was \"still an issue of men not willing to challenge\" sexual harassment\n\nThe future generations commissioner said that misogyny \"should be an offence\" and \"something that the police should be taking seriously\".\n\nSophie Howe said she thought the only reason why it was not an offence was because of the \"scale of the problem\".\n\n\"Millions of women probably across the UK are experiencing this sort of thing everyday.\n\n\"So I think there is a reluctance around how you can possibly start policing this.\"\n\nHowever she said you have \"got to start somewhere, and it is down to what your priorities are\".\n\nShe added that men should be educated about calling out sexual harassment.\n\nMs Howe also said she had spoken to her four sons, aged nine to 21, about misogyny and harassment scenarios.\n\nShe said she had experienced sexually explicit remarks and \"many times\" whilst walking on the street, had been followed by men driving slowly next to her.\n\n\"Speaking to them over the weekend, I think there is still this issue of men not willing to challenge,\" she said.\n\nShe said she gave them one scenario in which they said the men involved were \"probably just having a laugh with friends\".\n\n\"I would like to think that my boys have been brought up to be feminists to be committed and interested in women's rights - even then that was the response I was getting,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"It might start out as a comment to make you laugh but\u2026 the more that society makes these things acceptable, the more that those people who are rapists, who are the sort of people who want to stalk, the more acceptable that becomes in their minds.\"\n\nMr Drakeford said that earlier this year \"women were contacting us saying they didn't safe being on their own on a dark January evening\", which prompted a change to Covid rules on exercise outdoors.\n\n\"Women need to be safe and there are practical things that can be done by public authorities, to try and assist that, but then it is feeling safe as well.\n\n\"In this instance, perception and reality both need to be addressed,\" he said.\n\nDeputy Minister Jane Hutt said that a \"deep change in society\" in needed to tackle violence against women.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has appeared in court in Iran, a week after her ankle tag was removed having served five years in prison, her lawyer said.\n\nThe British-Iranian charity worker was ordered to appear on charges of propaganda against the regime.\n\nThe judge told her to expect a verdict within seven working days, according to the Free Nazanin campaign.\n\nHer husband Richard said the British embassy in Tehran had declined to accompany his wife to Sunday's trial.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed in 2016 for allegedly working against the Iranian government, which she has always denied.\n\nAccording to her lawyer, she was accused in Sunday's hearing of participating in a demonstration outside the Iranian embassy in London 12 years ago and giving an interview to the BBC Persian service, said BBC correspondent Caroline Hawley.\n\nHer lawyer said the atmosphere in court had been calm and he hoped she would be acquitted because she has already served five years on a more serious charge.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab called it \"unacceptable and unjustifiable\" that Iran has chosen to continue with the second \"wholly arbitrary\" case, saying the Iranian government has \"deliberately put her through a cruel and inhumane ordeal\".\n\nHe added: \"Nazanin must be allowed to return to her family in the UK without further delay. We continue to do all we can to support her.\"\n\nThere is a good reason why Richard Ratcliffe describes his wife as a \"pawn\" in a game of chess, a bargaining chip. And she's not alone.\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - together with several other dual nationals from a range of countries - is caught up in the middle of some complicated geopolitics.\n\nThe backdrop to her case is the West's difficult relationship with Iran, and a growing emphasis by Iran on \"hostage diplomacy\".\n\nThe charity worker was told explicitly that her imprisonment was linked to a \u00a3400m debt owed by Britain for an arms deal to Iran that was done before she was even born.\n\nIn the days of the Shah, Iran had bought tanks from Britain but, after the 1979 Revolution, they were not delivered.\n\nThe UK and Iran have been haggling in court over interest on the debt for years. And when UK PM Boris Johnson spoke by phone to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last week to demand Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, the Iranian president apparently complained that no \"practical progress\" had been made by the UK to repay the debt.\n\nWhatever happens in the courts, the message from Iran seems to be, if not loud, at least pretty clear.\n\nMuch less clear is when her ordeal will be over.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, Labour's Tulip Siddiq, said she was \"deeply concerned about the possible outcome\" and said the anxiety of waiting for a verdict will \"just add to her ongoing mental torture\".\n\nShe also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not being \"capable of ensuring that British officials attended her court hearing to ensure a fair trial\".\n\nMs Siddiq said: \"Now is the time to bring Nazanin home to the UK, and our government has a responsibility to pull every possible lever to make that happen.\"\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family fear the court case could be used to block her return to the UK because the Iranian government wants to keep her for diplomatic leverage.\n\nMr Johnson has called for her \"immediate release\".\n\nEarlier, Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been due to report to court at 09:00 Iranian time (05:30 GMT), but did not know when her trial would be heard, what it would entail or how long it would be.\n\nShe was expected to appear in the Revolutionary Court, in front of the same judge who conducted her earlier hearings.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Ratcliffe said that neither he nor his wife had any idea what to expect. \"It's like trying to read tea leaves,\" he said.\n\n\"The charges are irrelevant. This is not a real court process. This is not a fair trial - it's an act of abuse.\n\n\"Nazanin is now pretty stressed. She is extremely twitchy, restless and agitated.\"\n\nMr Ratcliffe had hoped the British ambassador would accompany his wife to the trial, but said the British embassy in Tehran had declined.\n\n\"I am disappointed that the embassy has declined to accompany Nazanin to the Revolutionary Court,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"To my mind, it is a missed opportunity to protect her, a missed opportunity to stand up for her as British, and it is not the first. I hope that timidity is not a choice that we come to regret.\"\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it had formally requested access to the hearing.\n\nAmnesty International UK said it was disappointed UK officials did not attend Sunday's hearing \"to show Nazanin the kind of support she needs and is entitled to\".\n\nDirector Kate Allen added: \"One trumped-up case against Nazanin was bad enough - a second one is an act of cruelty.\"\n\nThe case comes after a charity warned in a medical report sent to the UK government that the 43-year-old was suffering from major depression and PTSD and was in need of urgent treatment.\n\nThe report, commissioned by the human rights charity Redress, said she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence.\n\nBefore her ankle tag was recently removed, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March due to the coronavirus crisis.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Bank governor under fire for role in RBS scandal\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England has come under new criticism for failing to declare a potential conflict of interest in a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefitting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin.\n\nNow, it is reported that Andrew Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal.\n\nThat is despite being asked about it when he was appointed to his previous job as head of the city watchdog.\n\nThe Bank of England said there was no interest to declare.\n\nRBS, now called Natwest, was accused of putting its own interests ahead of its clients when it moved 16,000 small business customers to its Global Restructuring Group (GRG).\n\nMore than 90% of those customers suffered some form of mistreatment and many were financially ruined between 2009 and 2013.\n\nInternal emails later emerged highlighting abusive attitudes to small business customers, including one in which a banker wrote: \"Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.\"\n\nA government body, the Asset Protection Agency, was accused of driving the scandal after it pressured the bank to withdraw loans from business customers and obtain their assets.\n\nSome of those customers lost not only their livelihoods but also their marriages, which took a heavy toll on their physical and mental health.\n\nMr Bailey was asked about the GRG scandal in 2016 when he appeared before a Treasury Select committee to vet him for conflicts of interest before he was made chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nNow, The Times reports in that, and in other more recent hearings, Mr Bailey failed to mention his role helping the Treasury design the body that oversaw the troubled division of RBS.\n\nAccording to court testimony given by the former boss of the scandal-hit division, the Asset Protection Agency pressured the bank to withdraw loans from business customers and obtain their assets.\n\nThe agency, a division of the Treasury, had close oversight of GRG, signing off key decisions and pressuring staff to withdraw loans from customers rather than maintain support.\n\nThe former boss of the RBS division, Derek Sach, has previously testified that the Asset Protection Agency had no interest in customers and would have preferred the bank to \"flog\" businesses rather than support them.\n\nAnd in October 2016, BBC Newsnight and Buzzfeed revealed a cache of internal documents showing GRG was seeking to benefit financially by withdrawing support from business customers.\n\nKevin Hollinrake, co-chairman of the all party parliamentary group on fair business banking, told The Times Bailey \"must explain\" why there was no disclosure of the potential conflict of interest.\n\n\"On Andrew Bailey's watch, the FCA repeatedly avoided the opportunities to publish key evidence about the GRG scandal and failed to hold anyone to account,\" he said.\n\n\"That Bailey failed to declare his interest and involvement in the agency when it featured in the FCA report as a potential cause of the scandal or to [MPs] when questioned about it is extremely disturbing.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was ordered to investigate the scandal and it commissioned two firms of consultants, Promontory and Mazars, who reported back three years later ,although their findings were not disclosed.\n\nThe contents of the report only became public when the BBC obtained a copy of the document, which showed that over 90% of GRG customers had suffered mistreatment. Mr Bailey still refused to publish the report and instead launched a hunt for the leaker.\n\nIn 2018, after taking the second phase of the investigation in-house, the FCA decided not to take any enforcement action.\n\nThe Bank of England said Mr Bailey was not a decision maker in respect of that decision.\n\nMr Bailey's role in designing the agency that oversaw GRG will add to pressure on the governor after he was named in a report by an Appeal Court judge who criticised the FCA's handling of the \u00a3238m London Capital and Finance scandal, where thousands of retail investors lost large sums.",

            "content": "Chocolate maker Thorntons has said none of its stores will reopen after coronavirus lockdowns are lifted.\n\nThe decision to close its 61 shops will put more than 600 jobs at risk.\n\nThe company said it had been badly hit by the pandemic, which forced its stores to shut their doors during the crucial Christmas and Easter holidays.\n\n\"The obstacles we have faced and will continue to face on the High Street are too severe,\" said Thorntons retail director Adam Goddard.\n\n\"Despite our best efforts we have taken the difficult decision to permanently close our retail store estate.\"\n\nThorntons has been on the High Street for more than a century but these days history isn't enough to guarantee survival.\n\nIt was losing its way in the early 2000s with newer players, like Hotel Chocolat, entering the scene. It also embarked on a strategy of selling more chocolates through supermarkets and closing unprofitable shops.\n\nItalian food giant Ferrero bought the business in 2015 and has been trying to turn it around ever since. Over the last five years, it's shrunk from 252 to 61 stores.\n\nBut Ferrero has now thrown in the towel on Thorntons stores altogether, betting that the brand's future is now online and on the supermarket shelves.\n\nThis pandemic has created brutal trading conditions for so many traditional retailers. And the high street shakeout is still far from over.\n\nThorntons said it had spent \u00a345m transforming the business with changes to the way stores operate and the introduction of new cafes but its plans had been thrown off course by the pandemic.\n\nThe company, which was founded in Sheffield in 1911, said it would continue to sell its chocolate online and try to sell more through supermarkets.\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis, sales through its website have increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, it said.\n\nIt will also try to expand the range of products made at its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire and increase international sales.\n\nIn 2011, Thorntons announced plans to massively reduce the number of stores it had on the High Street and in shopping centres.\n\nIt said it would close up to 180 of the 364 stores it had at the time, following a strategic review.\n\nSince then, the number of stores has dwindled to 61.\n\nIn 2015, Italian food giant Ferrero bought the chocolate chain for \u00a3112m.\n\nIn a statement, the company said: \"We remain committed to this iconic British brand and will continue to invest further in the future potential of Thorntons to ensure we evolve with the times.\"\n\nThorntons is just the latest well-known name to suffer the impact that rolling lockdowns have had on the High Street as more people take to shopping online.\n\nMore than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to figures from the Local Data Company. That is an average rate of 48 closures a day.\n\nLast week, department store chain John Lewis announced plans to close more stores. Other casualties have included PSir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, which included Topshop and Dorothy Perkins.\n\nAre you a Thorntons employee?

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Two of the biggest names in hospitality have threatened to take the government to court over its plans to release England from lockdown.\n\nPunch Taverns founder Hugh Osmond and Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, said the industry is losing \u00a3200m a day.\n\nIn a letter to the prime minister, they said there is no \"evidence or justification\" to open shops five weeks before pubs and restaurants.\n\nThey said it is \"plainly irrational\".\n\nThe government has insisted the lockdown easing must be cautious if it is to be irreversible, adding that it will driven by data and not dates.\n\nUnder current plans, non-essential retail will be able to open from 12 April if new coronavirus infections are kept under control. Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens, will also be allowed to reopen then.\n\nBut pubs and restaurants will not be allowed to welcome customers through their doors to sit inside until at least 17 May.\n\nThe industry has long argued that pubs re-opening last July had a negligible effect on infections, which only began to rise after schools reopened. And the Chancellor recently defended his own Eat out to Help out scheme, arguing that it protected jobs.\n\nThe two men have asked the government to seek specific advice from scientists \"whether it is justifiable to prevent the hospitality industry opening whilst, at the same time, allowing non-essential shops to open\".\n\nThey argued that \"transmission is plainly higher in non-essential shops,\" and said they would pursue legal action if the government did not provide evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"This legal case will give a fighting chance to over three million people who work in hospitality, to the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors - large and small - forced into bankruptcy, and to millions of our loyal customers who have been deprived of the human social interaction they experience in our premises,\" Mr Osmond said.\n\nHe added that the extended lockdown for hospitality venues could have a \"potentially indirectly discriminatory effect\" on young people and people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds working in the sector.\n\n\"I believe we can show that discrimination and unsubstantiated beliefs, rather than facts, science and evidence, lie at the heart of much of the government's approach to hospitality, and these wrongs need to be righted.\"",

            "content": "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has defended himself after a former appeal court judge criticised evidence he gave to MPs over a scandal in which thousands lost their life savings.\n\nMr Bailey is the former boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nHe has been criticised by Dame Elizabeth Gloster for his role at the FCA in regulating London Capital & Finance, which collapsed in 2019.\n\nMr Bailey said responsibility and culpability were not the same thing.\n\nBefore becoming governor, Andrew Bailey was chief executive of the FCA, which was criticised in a report by Dame Elizabeth for failing to supervise and regulate LCF.\n\nHer report named Mr Bailey as responsible for that failure and said he had made legal representations to prevent responsibility for the FCA's failings being attributed to him by name.\n\nBefore the Treasury committee of MPs last month, Mr Bailey said he was \"angry\" and \"disturbed\" by her criticisms, adding it was \"not correct\" to say he did not want his name mentioned in the context of personal responsibility and that his apology for the failure had been misrepresented.\n\nThat prompted Dame Elizabeth to write to the committee releasing extracts of representations from Mr Bailey's legal team, revealing that they had asked for him not to be named on a number of different grounds.\n\nMore than 11,000 savers lost money in investing \u00a3238m in LCF, which went bust in 2019.\n\nHe replied: \"I never said that I was not responsible for everything that went on at the FCA. That was my role as CEO.\n\n\"The particular issue\u2026 was that the first draft of the report introduced responsibility and culpability together in an inseparable way and they're not the same thing.\"\n\nSeparately, Mr Bailey has come under new criticism following a report that he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated.\n\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefiting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin.\n\nNow it is reported that Mr Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal.\n\nThe Bank of England said there was no interest to declare.\n\nDuring the same BBC Today interview, Mr Bailey said he was \"not out of firepower\" in defending the UK economy as it recovers from the pandemic.\n\nHe said he was looking at \"new tools\" to deal with the UK's biggest economic shock in 300 years.\n\nThese could include negative interest rates, but \"that's not a view on whether we will use them or not\".\n\n\"The economy will actually get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019,\" he said.\n\nHowever, that was \"not much more than getting back to where we were pre-Covid\".\n\nMr Bailey said the Bank expected inflation to start rising towards its 2% target in \"the next two or three months\".\n\nBut he added that the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would need to see \"a lot more evidence\" that the inflationary trend was sustainable before acting, given the \"huge uncertainty\" over the economic effects of Covid.\n\n\"We are not out of tools, we are not out of firepower,\" Mr Bailey said.\n\nAlthough he did not commit one way or the other on the use of negative interest rates, he said it was \"appropriate to have that tool in the box\".\n\nThe Bank governor's comments follow months of public speculation about the possibility of negative rates, with several former and current Bank policymakers weighing in with their views.\n\nAt the same time, other commentators have been warning that the economy could overheat as the end of lockdown unleashes pent-up consumer demand, with a surge in inflation as a result.\n\nMr Bailey said he had seen \"no evidence\" to support fears that inflation could hit 4% or 5% as the recovery gathered pace.\n\nHe said the UK's vaccination campaign had been \"a great achievement\" and he was now \"more positive\" about the recovery, but he wanted to add \"a large dose of caution\".\n\nMr Bailey warned that new variants of the virus could still pose a risk to the recovery.\n\nHe also said the economic effects of the pandemic had been \"very unequal\".\n\n\"Covid has affected the low-paid more. There are more women in that section of the labour force,\" he said.\n\nEthnic minorities were also disproportionately affected, he added.\n\nBut he said it was \"very helpful\" that the furlough scheme was now projected to extend beyond the lifting of Covid restrictions, which should \"help to smooth that transition\".",

Our Streets\" and \"Black Lives Matter\" could be heard.\n\nEarlier, Wales's first minister said no-one could be \"anything but disturbed\" by scenes of policing at a vigil in London in memory of Sarah Everard.\n\nMark Drakeford said it was \"particularly\" the case because of the \"allegation that a member of the Metropolitan Police had carried out a murder of somebody\".\n\nThe Met has faced widespread criticism for its handling of the gathering.\n\nHundreds attended the demonstration outside Cardiff Bay police station on Monday evening\n\nHowever, the head of the force has defended how officers responded.\n\nHundreds of people gathered on London's Clapham Common on Saturday to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who was found dead a week after she disappeared on her way home in south London.\n\nPolice officers later handcuffed and removed a number of women from the gathering, arresting four people for public order and Covid offences.\n\nIn response to the scenes in London, Mr Drakeford said there was a \"contrast\" to the way events were handled in Wales.\n\n\"Here in Wales I think our police have always managed to respond to such events in a way that is sensitive to them, proportionate to what is going on, and allows people even in the extraordinary times we are in to mark something very significant in their lives,\" he said.\n\n\"In London, nobody could be anything but disturbed to see the scenes we've seen emerging, particularly as the precipitating event is the allegation that a member of the Metropolitan Police had carried out a murder of somebody.\n\n\"To see the same police force respond to people who wanted to mark that in a way, that I think can only give rise for very real concern.\"\n\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March, with her body being found a week later in Kent.\n\nMet Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with kidnap and murder.\n\nMet Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said she will not resign over the protests.\n\n\"Quite rightly, as far as I can see, my team felt that this is now an unlawful gathering which poses a considerable risk to people's health,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't think anybody who was not in the operation can actually pass a detailed comment on the rightness and wrongness... This is fiendishly difficult policing.\"\n\nMr Drakeford also raised concerns about the UK government's policing bill, and its provisions on protests.\n\n\"This is not the moment at all for the UK government to be seeking to cut back on people's ability to get together when conditions allow and express their concerns about the way that things happen in our society,\" he said.\n\nOpposition MPs, including Labour and Plaid Cymru, plan to vote against the bill. It has been defended by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said it was a \"very sensible package of measures\".\n\nIn common with the other three UK nations, coronavirus laws set in Wales by the Welsh Government restrict large gatherings.\n\nNo more than four people from two households can gather outside.\n\nEarlier this year Bianca Ali faced a \u00a3500 fine for breaching Covid rules after allegedly organising a protest in Cardiff over the death of a man who died after he was released from police custody.\n\nHis death prompted several days of protest. Ms Ali is understood to be contesting the fine.\n\nMark Drakeford said he had \"cause for concern\" by the police response\n\nIn response to a question on the Welsh Government views' about protests under the regulations, and whether they can be lawfully held, a spokesperson told BBC Wales: \"We are in the middle of public health emergency.\n\n\"For everyone wishing to hold peaceful vigils, we would ask people to follow the rules which have protected us all from coronavirus and consider holding online events until larger gatherings can be held.\"",

            "section": "Scotland",
            "content": "Scotland's chief medical officer has said he is \"wholly confident\" in the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nA number of European countries have suspended use of the vaccine amid fears that it may cause blood clots.\n\nHowever, watchdogs including the World Health Organisation have found no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\n\nDr Gregor Smith said he would \"categorically state that we remain confident\" in the vaccine programme.\n\nAnd First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to continue to come forward for appointments when invited, saying they provide \"significant protection\" against the virus.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland has joined countries including the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway in pausing their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - people developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered.\n\nHowever, with almost five million people having been given a first dose of the vaccine across Europe, AstraZeneca said this number of clots was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\n\nBoth the WHO and the European Medicines Agency have said there is no indication that the jab was causing the blood clots.\n\nDr Gregor Smith said studies had found \"no causal link\" between the vaccine and blood clots\n\nThe use of vaccines in the UK is governed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which has backed the continued use of the AstraZeneca jab.\n\nAt the Scottish government's daily Covid-19 briefing, Dr Smith said there had been \"no causal link between any of these incidents and the AstraZeneca vaccine\".\n\nHe said: \"What we can say at this point in time is that looking at the data about blood clots both in Europe and the UK, it is no more common to have an episode of a blood clot than you would see in the general population - in fact it is somewhat less.\n\n\"Between one and two people in a thousand would suffer a blood clot in any given year. Among the 17 million or so vaccinations given with the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, we have not seen any signal coming through whatsoever to suggest there are any more blood clots than expected in that population.\n\n\"People in that population are going to continue to become ill anyway - they will have events that they would have had whether they had had the vaccine or not.\n\n\"What we are looking for in this data, what the MHRA will be looking for, is any signs of those events being over or above what is expected - and they are not seeing that.\"\n\nNicola Sturgeon said the pace of the vaccine programme should \"pick up significantly\" in the coming days\n\nMs Sturgeon said she would be happy to be given the AstraZeneca jab, and urged others to continue to come forward.\n\nThe first minister said she was in the age group that should be given a first dose of the vaccine by mid-April, saying she was \"hoping to see my blue envelope appear at some point in the next couple of weeks\".\n\nShe added: \"As soon as I get that, I will be there without hesitation, regardless of which of the vaccines I am being offered. And I would urge everybody getting an invitation to be vaccinated to be vaccinated, because it provides you and people you live with significant protection.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said \"virtually all\" Scots over the age of 65 had now had a first dose of vaccine, as had 53% of 60-64 year olds, 41% of 55-59 year olds and 33% of those aged 50 to 54.\n\nShe said the pace of vaccination should \"pick up significantly\" in the coming days, with supplies expected to be available for 400,000 doses to be administered over the course of the week.\n\nThis is projected to continue into next month, with the government \"on track\" to hit its target of completing all priority groups - including over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with underlying health conditions - by mid-April.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"That will be a really significant milestone, if and when we meet that target. It provides all of us with firmer grounds for hope for the months and weeks ahead.\"\n\nThe first minister will set out plans for further easing of lockdown restrictions at Holyrood on Tuesday, with moves to re-open shops and hospitality venues and lift the \"stay at home\" order expected to be scheduled through April and into May.\n\nIn his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference, leader Douglas Ross challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\n\nHe said: \"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone - but they deserve more clarity.\"\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for a \"balanced\" approach, saying: \"We have to make sure this is the last lockdown.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let's not just think the silver bullet is the vaccine - it is one part of trying to drive down the virus, but if we are going to truly have an elimination strategy we have got to suppress the virus to next to zero levels and isolate it at those small levels.\n\n\"In order to do that we've got to up the level of testing, and then alongside that we need to isolate the virus using our tracing system in a more effective way.\"",

Police said he had attacked them with a stick, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague.\n\nDutch police later said a warning shot had been fired as officers cleared away the demonstrators.

            "content": "Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK \"match-fit\" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy.\n\nThe prime minister said there would be \"more investment\" in infrastructure and skills around the country.\n\nHe also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride.\n\nThe government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday.\n\nBut a group of MPs has warned that \"general ineptitude\" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army.\n\nThe Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat.\n\nSome details are being pre-released, including the plan to move 500 jobs to the Foreign Office's East Kilbride hub - which follows news that the Cabinet Office will transfer at least 500 civil servants to nearby Glasgow by 2024.\n\nThe government has promised \"further commitments\" to \"strengthening the UK's core industrial base\" in the Integrated Review, including building ships in Scotland and armoured vehicles in Wales.\n\nThere will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added.\n\nThe Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War.\n\nBut the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology.\n\nAnd, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom.\n\nMinisters argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad.\n\nThe test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people.\n\n\"So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people.\"\n\nHe added that the UK's \"international ambitions must start at home\", with investment in regional industry \"ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world\".\n\nThe government has said \"further jobs\" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England.\n\nIt has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by \u00a36.6bn in real terms, but, since then, it has increased by \u00a33bn in real terms.\n\nA report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries.\n\nIt described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as \"woeful\" and criticised what it called \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" over the past two decades.\n\nIn a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are\".\n\nHe added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\".",

Given his own lack of transparency, that was, at best, hypocritical.\n\n\"The piece spectacularly fails on transparency grounds. Had Greenslade been open with me back in 2014, I would have been able to come to a different judgement about it overall.\n\n\"So I am sincerely sorry to M\u00e1ir\u00eda Cahill, both for the article and for the upset it must have caused her.\"",

            "section": "Africa",
            "content": "This Benin Bronze sold to a private collector for a record fee of \u00a310m\n\nCountless historic artefacts were looted from around the world during the colonial era and taken to Europe but there is now a growing campaign to return them. Among the most famous are the Benin Bronzes seized from modern-day Nigeria. Barnaby Phillips finds out about one family's dilemma.\n\nOne morning in April 2016, a woman walked into Barclays Bank on London's exclusive Park Lane, to retrieve a mysterious object that had been locked in the vaults for 63 years.\n\nAttendants ushered her downstairs. Three men waited upstairs, perched anxiously on an uncomfortable sofa, watching customers go about their business.\n\nTwenty minutes later the woman appeared, carrying something covered in an old dishcloth. She unwrapped it, and everyone gasped.\n\nA youthful face cast in bronze or brass stared out at them. He had a beaded collar around his neck and a gourd on his head.\n\nThe men, an art dealer called Lance Entwistle and two experts from the auctioneers Woolley and Wallis, recognised it as an early Benin Bronze head, perhaps depicting an oba, or king, from the 16th Century.\n\nIt was in near-immaculate condition, with the dark grey patina of old bronze, much like a contemporary piece from the Italian Renaissance. They suspected it was worth millions of pounds. The bank staff quickly led them into a panelled room, where they placed the head on a table.\n\nThe woman who went down into the vaults is a daughter of an art dealer called Ernest Ohly, who died in 2008.\n\nI have chosen to call her Frieda and not reveal her married name to protect her privacy.\n\nErnest's father, William Ohly, who was Jewish, fled Nazi Germany and was prominent in London's mid-century art scene.\n\nWilliam Ohly's exhibitions in the late 1940s attracted aesthetes and celebrities\n\nWilliam Ohly lived \"at the nexus of culture, society and artists\", says Entwistle.\n\nHis \"Primitive Art\" exhibitions attracted collectors, socialites, and artists such as Jacob Epstein, Lucian Freud, Henry Moore, Francis Bacon, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell.\n\nHe died in 1955. Ernest Ohly inherited his love of art, but was a more reserved character.\n\n\"A very, very difficult man to know. He didn't let anything out. You did not know what he was thinking,\" said Entwistle.\n\nErnest Ohly's death provoked a ripple of excitement at the lucrative top end of the ethnographic art world. He was rumoured to have an extensive collection. His statues from Polynesia and masks from West Africa were auctioned in 2011 and 2013. And that, dealers assumed, was that.\n\nBut his children knew otherwise. In old age, he had told them he had one more sculpture. It was in a Barclays safe box and not to be sold, he specified, unless there was another Holocaust.\n\nIn 2016 matters were taken out of the children's hands. Barclays on Park Lane was closing its safe boxes; it told customers to collect their belongings.\n\nI met Lance Entwistle in 2019, in his library lined with books on African sculpture. His website said his company has been \"leading tribal art dealers for over 40 years\".\n\n\"Tribal art\" is a term that Western museums now avoid, but is still common in the world of auctions and private sales.\n\nI was bowled over. It was beautiful, moving and its emergence from obscurity was so exciting\"\n\nEntwistle has rarely been to Africa, and never to Nigeria, but he's well connected. The British Museum, the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris and the Metropolitan in New York have all bought pieces from him.\n\nI asked him how he had felt when Frieda pulled the cloth away from the Benin Bronze head in the bank.\n\n\"I was bowled over,\" he said. \"It was beautiful, moving, and its emergence from obscurity was so exciting. I'm very used to being told about a Benin head, a Benin plaque, a Benin horse and rider. Generally I'm not excited because 99 times out of 100 they're fake, and often the remaining 1% has been stolen.\"\n\nProvenance is everything in Entwistle's world. This time, thanks to the Ernest Ohly connection, he was confident he was dealing with a bona fide piece.\n\nHe told Frieda the Benin Bronze head was significant and unusual, and convinced her to take it home in a taxi, to her terraced house in Tooting, south London.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were brought to Europe in the spring of 1897, the loot of British soldiers and sailors who conquered the West African kingdom of Benin, in modern day Nigeria's Edo state.\n\nAlthough they are called Benin Bronzes, they are actually thousands of brass and bronze castings and ivory carvings. When some were displayed in the British Museum that autumn, they caused a sensation.\n\nAfricans, the British believed at the time, did not possess skills to produce pieces of such sophistication or beauty. Nor were they supposed to have much history.\n\nBut the bronzes - some portrayed Portuguese visitors in medieval armour - were evidently hundreds of years old.\n\nThey were our documents, our archives, the 'photographs' of our kings. When they were taken our history was exhumed\"\n\nBenin had been denigrated in British newspapers as a place of savagery, a \"City of Blood\". Now those newspapers described the Bronzes as \"surprising\", \"remarkable\" and admitted they were \"baffled\".\n\nSome of these bronzes are still owned by descendants of those who pillaged Benin, while others have passed from owner to owner.\n\nVictor Ehikhamenor, an artist from Edo state, told me the bronzes were not made only for aesthetic enjoyment.\n\n\"They were our documents, our archives, the 'photographs' of our kings. When they were taken our history was exhumed.\"\n\nBut as their value in the West has increased, they've also become prestige investments, held by the wealthy and reclusive.\n\nLondon auction sales tell the story. In 1953, Sotheby's sold a Benin Bronze head for \u00a35,500. The price raised eyebrows; the previous record for a Benin head was \u00a3780.\n\nIn 1968 Christie's sold a Benin head for \u00a321,000. (It had been discovered months earlier by a policeman who was pottering around his neighbour's greenhouse and noticed something interesting amidst the plants).\n\nIn the 1970s, \"Tribal Art\" prices soared, and Benin Bronzes led the way. And so it went on, all the way to 2007 when Sotheby's in New York sold a Benin head for $4.7m (\u00a32.35m).\n\nEntwistle kept an eye on that 2007 sale. The buyer, whose identity was not publicly revealed, was one of his trusted clients.\n\nNine years later, presented by Frieda with the challenge of selling Ernest Ohly's head, Lance knew where to turn.\n\n\"It was the first client I offered it to, which is what you want, there was no need to shop around,\" he said.\n\nThere was only a minor haggle over price. The client, Entwistle insisted, was motivated by his love of African art.\n\n\"He will never sell, in my view.\" Whoever he is, wherever he is, he paid another world record fee.\n\nThe \"Ohly head\", as Entwistle calls it, was sold for \u00a310m - a figure not previously disclosed.\n\nIf you envisaged the woman who sold the world's most expensive Benin Bronze, you might not come up with Frieda.\n\nWe met in the Tate Modern gallery, overlooking the Thames. She had travelled from Tooting by underground. She is a grandmother, with grey close-cropped hair and glasses. She used to work in children's nurseries, but is retired.\n\n\"My family is riddled with secrets,\" she said. \"My father refused to speak about his Jewish ancestry.\"\n\nShe did her own research on relatives who were killed in Nazi concentration camps. Ernest Ohly was haunted, \"paranoid\", says Frieda, by the prospect of another catastrophe engulfing the Jews.\n\nSix million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust - and, according to the Jewish Claims Conference, the Nazis seized an estimated 650,000 artworks and religious items from Jews and other victims.\n\nThe artworks produced in Benin City still seek to chronicle events - like this one depicting the slave trade\n\nErnest Ohly distrusted strangers and lived in a world of cash and secret objects. He kept a suitcase of \u00a350 notes under the bed.\n\n\"Ernie the Dealer\" was the family nickname. The children grew up surrounded by art. But by the end he was tired of life.\n\nHis house was chaotic, his Persian rugs infested with moths. The family found the suitcase of banknotes but discovered they were no longer legal tender.\n\nErnest Ohly may have let things slide, but he had been a formidable collector.\n\n\"He and my grandfather never went to Africa or the South Pacific, but got their knowledge from being around objects,\" said Freida.\n\n\"There was a whole group of European dealers in London, in the 1940s through to the 1970s.\"\n\nThe British Empire was ending, and the deaths of its last administrators and soldiers brought rich pickings.\n\n\"I never understood why my father was so interested in reading obituary pages. The Telegraph, the Times, really studying them. If they were Foreign Office, armed forces, anything to do with Empire, he wrote to the widows.\"\n\nErnest Ohly listed his buys in ledger books. That's how Entwistle found what he was looking for: \"Benin Bronze head... Dec 51, \u00a3230\" from Glendining's - a London auctioneers where he also bought coins and stamps.\n\nErnest Ohly's ledger showed how much he paid for the Benin Bronze in 1951\n\nIn today's money, that is just over \u00a37,000. In other words, a substantial purchase. But Ernest Ohly knew what he was doing. He had a steal. He put the head in the safe box in 1953, and it stayed there until 2016.\n\n\"It was like a lump of gold,\" said Frieda. The windfall was not quite as large as it might have been.\n\nErnest Ohly's affairs were a mess, and the taxman took a substantial amount. Still, Frieda says, she can sleep easy now. The Benin head bought care for her family, and property for her children.\n\nFrieda is married to a man of Caribbean descent - and her son is a journalist.\n\nA few years ago he wrote an article about how the Edo - the people of the Benin Kingdom - tried to stop the sale at Sotheby's of a Benin ivory mask.\n\nIn fact, although he did not know this, it was a mask that his great-grandfather, William Ohly, displayed at his gallery in 1947.\n\nThe article described Edo outrage that the family who owned the mask - relatives of a British official who looted it in 1897 - should profit from what they regarded as theft and a war crime.\n\nFrieda is too intelligent and sensitive not to appreciate the layers of irony behind her story. She had followed the arguments about whether the Benin Bronzes should be returned to Nigeria.\n\nBritain has laws to enable the return of art looted by the Nazis, but there is no similar legislation to cover its own colonial period.\n\n\"Part of me will always feel guilty for not giving it to the Nigerians\u2026 It's a murky past, tied up with colonialism and exploitation.\"\n\n\"But that's in the past, lots of governments aren't stable and things have been destroyed. I'm afraid I took the decision to sell. I stand by it. I wanted my family to be secure.\"\n\nFrieda is not the only owner of Benin Bronzes who has wrestled with their conscience in recent years.\n\nMark Walker, a doctor from Wales, returned two Bronzes which had been taken by his grandfather, an officer on the 1897 expedition.\n\nHe received a hero's welcome in Benin City.\n\nOthers are hesitant. In an imposing west London mansion block I met an elderly woman whose grandfather also looted Bronzes in 1897.\n\nTen, or even five years ago, it would not have been difficult to get somebody in her position to talk. But today the owners of Benin Bronzes are cautious, and I agreed to hide this woman's identity.\n\nShe showed me two brass oro \"prophecy birds\". I asked if they made her feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"I've felt misgivings, considerations that crossed my mind\u2026 Maybe misgivings is too strong a word. I don't feel like giving them anything.\" There was a long silence.\n\n\"You know,\" she said, \"one bumbles along for 77 years, and suddenly this has become a sensitive subject. It never was before.\"\n\nFrieda and I left the Tate and were walking along the Thames.\n\nI was about to say goodbye. Unprompted, she returned to the Benin Bronzes.\n\nSometimes, she said, she wished her father had sold that head when he was still alive.\n\nA dilemma would have been taken out of her hands.\n\n\"It was difficult for me,\" she said again. \"Part of me felt we should have given it back.\" Then she was gone.\n\nBarnaby Phillips is a former BBC Nigeria correspondent. His book Loot; Britain and the Benin Bronzes will be published on 1 April.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "The Court of Appeal has dismissed a legal challenge against the Crown Prosecution Service over its policy on prosecuting serious sexual offences.\n\nEnd Violence Against Women had said the CPS's move away from a \"merits-based approach\" in 2016-18 was \"unlawful\".\n\nThe group had claimed the change led to a \"shocking and unprecedented\" fall in rape cases leading to criminal charges.\n\nBut the court agreed with the CPS that the change in guidance \"was not a change of legal substance\".\n\nEnd Violence Against Women (EVAW) had been aiming to show there was a change in policy in the way the CPS handled rape cases, and that the way the prosecutors went about that change was unlawful.\n\nDuring the hearing, the group had said the CPS adopted what is known as the \"bookmaker's approach\" to cases, which saw prosecutors considering what may happen based on past experience of similar cases, rather than its earlier \"merits-based approach\" based on objective assessment of the evidence in that case alone.\n\nLegally binding guidance on the old approach was removed in 2017, and the CPS introduced a 60% conviction rate target in relation to rape cases.\n\nEVAW's lawyers had argued both the volume of cases and the charging rate fell following this change in guidance.\n\nIn 2019/20 fewer than 2,000 rape cases were prosecuted - less than 3% of the more than 55,000 rapes reported to the police.\n\nAs part of their case against the CPS, End Violence against Women Coalition used Bonny Turner's experience of reporting rape and prosecutors deciding not to charge the suspect.\n\nMs Turner, who has waived her right to anonymity, said a man who raped her in 2016 later apologised and voluntarily confessed - but the CPS still chose not to prosecute the suspect.\n\nShe believes her case did not get to court partly because the CPS changes in 2017 led to prosecutors dropping cases to \"artificially inflate their conviction figures\".\n\nFollowing the Court of Appeal's dismissal, she told BBC News: \"Right now I'm feeling deeply shocked, angry, devastated really. Today's judgement, for me, really sends a clear signal to violent men and boys - that they can rape with impunity.\"\n\n\"Effectively, rape has been decriminalised and the courts have missed this opportunity to put right or to acknowledge the fact that victims of rape like me have been robbed of justice for the last few years,\" she said.\n\nMs Turner has previously spoken about how she was prevented from accessing therapy after being raped, because of restrictions from the judicial system.\n\nThe job of the CPS is to decide whether or not someone should be charged with an offence in England and Wales, based on various factors - such as whether there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect that the defendant could be convicted. The body is independent of police and the government.\n\nCPS director of public prosecutions Max Hill said the court's decision confirmed that the CPS \"was neither irrational nor unlawful in its approach to updating guidance for prosecutors, and that there was no change of approach in the way the CPS prosecutes rape cases\".\n\n\"Today's outcome means we can now give our full focus to the extensive programme of work under way to address the gap between reported rapes and cases going to court,\" he added.\n\nAndrea Simon, End Violence Against Women's director, said the group was \"deeply disappointed\" by the dismissal.\n\nShe said the court had \"given the CPS the benefit of the doubt\" and \"we still lack alternative answers\" to why rape prosecutions have fallen.\n\n\"Thousands of rape victims continue to be let down by a broken criminal justice system,\" Ms Simon added.\n\nCourt of Appeal judges Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Lord Justice Holroyde and Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing found the EVAW's case failed on every ground.\n\nThey said the evidence provided by Mr Hill \"comprehensively undermines the grounds advanced by the claimant\" and that senior CPS managers were perfectly entitled to apply a \"nudge on the tiller\" to address concerns about falling conviction rates for rape cases.\n\nLord Burnett said the judges also rejected a submission that the CPS's decisions \"created any risk of systemic illegality\".\n\nEVAW said it would seek to appeal against the court's decision.\n\nThe group added it would have to pay about \u00a375,000 to cover the CPS's legal fees, unless the costs were waived.",

He was remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March.\n\nMs Everard disappeared when walking home to Brixton from Clapham in south London on 3 March.\n\nHer body was found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, Westminster Magistrates Court heard.",

The seven-piece boyband had hoped to be the first K-Pop act to win a Grammy with their hit single, Dynamite.\n\nThe awards were announced online ahead of the main Grammys ceremony on Sunday night, which is expected to be a hybrid of live and pre-taped performances.\n\nHost Trevor Noah said the show would be different to the usual event, where music's biggest stars congregate at Los Angeles' Staples Center, but promised a night of spectacular entertainment.\n\n\"They have figured out how to make an awards show for the time as opposed to trying to crowbar an awards show into it,\" he said last week.\n\n\"It's not Zoom, it's not pandemic-y... The bands are sort of going to be performing for each other.\"\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 had the most nominations going into the ceremony - with nine in total. If she wins two more, she will overtake bluegrass singer Alison Krauss as the most-awarded woman in Grammy history.\n\nTaylor Swift and Dua Lipa both have six nominations each, alongside rapper Roddy Ricch.\n\nBritish star Harry Styles will open the ceremony, with other performances due from BTS, Taylor Swift, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Chris Martin of Coldplay.\n\nThe early pre-ceremony raced through dozens of genre categories - from world music to rap and bluegrass - as well as some of the more esoteric awards, like best packaging (which went to rock supergroup The Desert Sessions for their album Vols 11 & 12).\n\nMegan Thee Stallion's win in the best rap category could make her a strong contender for song of the year\n\nKanye West took the Grammy for his gospel album Jesus is King, while John Prine won two posthumous awards for his song I Love Life.\n\nThe star, who died last April of Covid-19, was honoured with best American roots performance and American roots song.\n\nLondon-born musician Jacob Collier made Grammy history by becoming the first British artist ever to win a prize for each of his first four albums.\n\nThe 26-year-old, who is also up for album of the year at the main ceremony, won the best arrangement for his track He Won't Hold You.\n\nNigeria's Burna Boy won the best global music album for Twice As Tall album; while his fellow countryman Wizkid shared the award for best music video with Beyonce and her daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nIn the rock categories, The Strokes picked up best album for The New Abnormal; and Fiona Apple's Fetch The Bolt Cutters took home best alternative album.\n\nThe award show is taking place against the backdrop of controversy surrounding its voting procedures.\n\nCanadian superstar The Weeknd said he will boycott the awards in future due to what he described as the \"secret committees\" that vote for the winners.\n\nHe was a surprise snub at this year's ceremony despite having one of 2020's biggest-selling albums.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "content": "Sarah Everard: What went wrong at the Clapham vigil?\n\nMaintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe.\n\nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in.\n\nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head.\n\nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control.\n\nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing.\n\nEarlier in the week it became increasingly clear that people up and down the UK wanted to hold vigils for Sarah Everard.\n\nWomen in London, organising under the Reclaim These Streets banner, approached Met commanders for their help in setting up a vigil on Clapham Common in south London, close to where Ms Everard was last seen alive.\n\nThe police said a demo would be illegal under the coronavirus lockdown regulations.\n\nAnd so the women and their lawyers asked the High Court to make a declaration that would force the police to think again.\n\nThe problem is that the law is not that clear cut.\n\nFor almost a year, the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and the public grasping for answers as to what is possible in public. It's so complex we've even seen people fined for walking while holding a cup of tea.\n\nGatherings in public are generally banned in England but, at the same time, the rules recognise there are \"reasonable excuses\" to be outside.\n\nBut the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses.\n\nNo matter what the Covid regulations say, there is an overarching right to freedom of expression that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. That means the police have a legal duty to help make safe protests possible.\n\nBut that right is not an absolute trump card - it can be interfered with if the police can show they have good reason to stop an event happening.\n\nAnd after hours of difficult legal argument on Friday, the judge refused to intervene and basically told the two sides to work it out for themselves with all those legal principles in mind.\n\nIn the absence of further legal clarity, the organisers claimed victory. They said the police had to now negotiate a sensible well-run vigil.\n\nThen, the police pushed back hard. They said they too had been vindicated. They could not authorise a potentially unlimited demonstration that would become an enormous Covid-spreading event. Stay at home, they said.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the organisers abandoned their plans amid a very serious risk they could each face a \u00a310,000 fine for organising a lockdown-breaking gathering.\n\nBut by that point, it was inevitable that people would turn up at Clapham Common, whether or not there was going to be a public event. It was the talk of social media.\n\nSo given that racing certainty, and the lack of official marshals that Reclaim These Streets said they would have provided had the police agreed to a vigil, what was the police's plan to keep people safe?\n\nThe turning point in Scotland Yard's tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, around 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: \"At this point, officers on the ground were faced with a very difficult decision.\n\n\"Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.\"\n\nAnd so, they tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people whom they believed were contributing to the crowding.\n\nPatsy Stevenson, the red-haired woman caught on camera being handcuffed on the ground at the bandstand, received a \u00a3200 Covid fine as police tried to remove her from the area.\n\nShe has not been accused of, or charged with, violence - but was there any elsewhere?\n\nThere was definitely a lot of anger - with some of the crowd chanting obscenities at the police at one point.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Federation, representing frontline officers, says 26 of them were assaulted yesterday at Clapham - punched, kicked and spat at.\n\nPictures obtained by the Press Association clearly show three instances of officers being forcibly pushed and a van's wing mirror being deliberately vandalised. Guess what? All three instances involved men, not women.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball has said the Met did not want to be in the position where it had to turn to enforcement. But what's not clear is why this demonstration was considered to be so much more of a Covid risk than others that commanders couldn't find a way to make it possible.\n\nPolice forces elsewhere in the UK were waiting for a lead from the Met. But those that saw DIY vigils - albeit far smaller ones - appeared to take a stand-back approach.\n\nThe better comparison is Black Lives Matter last summer, when there were large crowds in London and elsewhere that were clearly not socially distancing.\n\nWhy the difference? That, and other questions about how the operation unfolded, may have been answered in the report that's been sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel.\n\nShe's now asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out its own external review of the event - and what Ms Patel ultimately concludes may dictate whether Dame Cressida survives calls for her to go.\n\nWhile the commissioner is accountable to the Mayor of London, who has raised his own serious concerns after a meeting with Dame Cressida, the Home Secretary is jointly responsible for deciding who gets the job - and when they should go.\n\nDame Cressida is highly respected both in policing and government - far more so than some of her predecessors - but she remains a controversial figure for many others.\n\nShe commanded the 2005 operation that led to the shooting dead of Jean Charles De Menezes, after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber - although a jury exonerated her of any personal wrongdoing.\n\nMore recently, she called for better powers to deal with Extinction Rebellion's repeated occupations of parts of London. The government agreed - and the home secretary's proposals to greatly expand the police's ability to curtail demonstrations goes before Parliament on Monday.\n\nAsk most police officers who have experience of covering public protests, and they will tell you they often feel - individual mistakes besides - it is a no-win situation when things go wrong. (Just last week I was talking about this very dilemma on BBC Newscast.)\n\nIt would be something of a terrible twist of fate for the commissioner - the first woman in the post - to lose her job in these circumstances.",

The tides are strong in the next few days in combination with the wind.\"\n\nMore than \u00a352,000 of a \u00a375,000 target has been raised by the men's families - enough to fund a specialist boat, team and equipment to begin searching.\n\nA life raft from the boat was found off Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland by HM Coastguard and has been positively identified by the Marine Accident Investigation branch (MAIB).\n\nAn investigation, run by the MAIB, is taking place and has included sonar surveys. The families are hoping their private searches will bring additional expertise to the investigation .\n\nMr Minard's mother Nathania, said: \"We are so grateful for all the support and generosity of the community.\n\n\"There has been so much activity around the fundraiser which in itself brings comfort and strength to the families.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who has supported, donated, wished us hope and has helped us spread the word.\"\n\nMuch of the money to pay for the searches has been raised in one-off donations through a fundraising website.\n\nSupporters have also been running raffles, ultra marathons and doing sponsored head shaves.\n\nThe families have also received support from comedian and writer Michael Palin, who said: \"The families are trying to raise funds to continue the search.\n\n\"I completely understand them not wanting to give up if there is any chance at all of recovering the sunken ship and the men who went down in her, and I hope there will be others like myself who can make a contribution.\"",

            "description": "A jet fuel made from food waste has the potential to reduce emissions from flying, scientists say.",
            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "A new approach to making jet fuel from food waste has the potential to massively reduce carbon emissions from flying, scientists say.\n\nCurrently, most of the food scraps that are used for energy around the world are converted into methane gas.\n\nBut researchers in the US have found a way of turning this waste into a type of paraffin that works in jet engines.\n\nThe authors of the new study say the fuel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 165% compared to fossil energy.\n\nThis figure comes from the reduction in carbon emitted from airplanes plus the emissions that are avoided when food waste is diverted from landfill.\n\nThe aviation industry worldwide is facing some difficult decisions about how to combine increased demand for flying with the need to rapidly cut emissions from the sector.\n\nIn the US, airlines currently use around 21 billion gallons of jet fuel every year, with demand expected to double by the middle of the century. At the same time, they have committed to cutting CO2 by 50%.\n\nWith the development of battery-powered airplanes for long haul flights a distant prospect at this point, much attention has focussed on replacing existing jet fuel with a sustainable alternative.\n\nIn fact the UK government has just announced a \u00a315m competition to encourage companies to develop jet fuel from household waste products.\n\nCurrent methods of making green jet fuel are based on a similar approach to making biodiesel for cars and heavy goods vehicles.\n\nIt normally requires the use of virgin vegetable oils as well as waste fats, oil and grease to make the synthetic fuel.\n\nAt present, it is more economical to convert these oils and wastes into diesel as opposed to jet fuel - which requires an extra step in the process, driving up costs.\n\nNow, researchers say that they have developed an alternative method able to turn food waste, animal manure and waste water into a competitive jet hydrocarbon.\n\nMuch of this material, termed wet-waste, is at present is turned into methane gas. However, the authors found a way of interrupting this process so it produced volatile fatty acids (VFA) instead of CH4.\n\nThe researchers were then able to use a form of catalytic conversion to upgrade the VFA to two different forms of sustainable paraffin.\n\nFood waste is a global problem and a major cause of global warming emissions\n\nWhen the two forms were combined they were able to blend 70% of the mixture with regular jet fuel, while still meeting the extremely strict quality criteria that Federal authorities impose on aircraft fuels.\n\n\"There's exciting jet fuels that rely on burning trash and dry waste but this actually works for those wastes that have high water content, which we normally dispose of in landfill,\" said Derek Vardon, a senior research engineer at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the lead author on the study.\n\n\"Being able to show that you can take these volatile fatty acids, and that there's a really elegant, simple way to turn it into jet fuel - that's where I see the broader applicability of this one, and folks can continue to develop and refine it.\"\n\nThe new fuel has a potentially significant impact on emissions as it not only limits the CO2 that comes from fossil sources used by the airlines, but it also gets rid of the methane that would bubble up from landfill if the waste food was just dumped.\n\nAnother major advantage is that this new fuel produces around 34% less soot than current standards. This is important because soot plays a key role in the formation of contrails from airplanes which adds a powerful warming effect to CO2 coming from the engines.\n\nEmissions from flying are set to rise rapidly over the next two decades\n\n\"That's where we see the most potential for this technology is that you're preventing methane emissions, and dramatically lowering the carbon footprint of jet fuel. And you just can't do that with fossil fuels without getting into things like offsets,\" said Derek Vardon.\n\nThe research team say they are planning to scale up the production of the new fuel and aim to have test flights with Southwest Airlines in 2023.\n\nMany environmental groups are sceptical about attempts to develop sustainable aviation fuels, believing that it amounts to green-washing. They argue that people should just fly less.\n\n\"Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet,\" Derek Vardon says.\n\n\"So we do want to definitely emphasise that reduction is the most important and most significant change you can make. But there's also pragmatism and need for aviation solutions now, so that's where we want to strike a balance as we need a basket of measures, to really start getting our carbon footprint down in a variety of sectors, including aviation.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).",

            "content": "The owner of a dog food firm brokered personal protective equipment deals worth \u00a3258m between the government and a Hong Kong firm, a BBC investigation has found.\n\nLondon-based Zoe Ley is likely to have been paid at last \u00a31m by the firm for her work in securing the deals last spring when the UK was short of PPE.\n\nMs Ley says she was approached by the UK's Covid taskforce when it was \"seeking urgent assistance\" to get PPE.\n\nMs Ley has a background in finance and banking.\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, rising global demand for PPE - including orders for gowns, gloves and face masks - led to shortages and a scramble for supplies for NHS workers.\n\nBecause of this, the UK government began awarding PPE contracts under emergency terms in which deals were handed to companies based on price and quality but without direct competition.\n\nThis has led to concerns over a lack of clarity about why particular suppliers were chosen and accusations that a so-called high-priority lane favoured firms with political connections.\n\nMs Ley's company, Life Partners, was set up in May 2020 to \"supply Covid-related products\" and helped broker two deals, worth \u00a3258m, between Hong Kong firm Worldlink Resources and the UK government.\n\nMs Ley, a former investment banker, also owns an organic dog food company called The Rockster. It is endorsed on its website by Prince Michael of Kent and actress Liz Hurley.\n\nIn an effort to establish Ms Ley's role in the PPE deals, an industry insider helping the BBC's Panorama, called Worldlink posing as someone trying to buy PPE.\n\nHe was told Ms Ley's involvement was crucial - her company was described as \"a bridge\" to the UK government.\n\nThe insider was also told she was paid 30% - likely a seven-figure sum - of Worldlink's profits on the deals. But Ms Ley's lawyers would not tell the BBC how much commission she earned.\n\nThe lawyers added that Worldlink paid Ms Ley less than 30%, saying Worldlink's own margins were at the lower end of the scale.\n\nZoe Ley runs a company making organic dog food that retails at about \u00a35 a tin\n\nMiddlemen and women are a common feature of PPE deals. Manufacturers in China often use local brokers who then reach out to people in other countries to help them sell to customers. This can add to the overall cost of the products.\n\nThe contract for one of the Worldlink deals - a \u00a3178m agreement to buy protective goggles for health workers - was only made public last week, after Panorama contacted the government. It blamed an \"admin error\" for having not published the deal earlier.\n\nThe contract for one of the Worldlink deals was one of 100 Covid-related contracts that remained unpublished when Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last month they were \"on the record for everyone to see\".\n\nAlso last month, a judge ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancock had acted unlawfully by not publishing Covid contracts in the required timeframe.\n\nThe ruling came amid concern over how contracts were being awarded. Deals that have prompted questions include major PPE contracts awarded to a Tory councillor last year and a \u00a330m deal given to a firm owned by a man who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home. That case is being investigated by the UK's medical regulator.\n\nIn November last year, a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the coronavirus pandemic was paid $28m (\u00a321m) in UK taxpayer cash.\n\nThe government has also been accused of favouring firms with political connections with a \"high-priority lane\" - in reality an email inbox available to ministers, civil servants or MPs and peers from any party.\n\nThe idea of the inbox was to help the government choose between the huge numbers of offers it was getting.\n\nA report from the National Audit Office found that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high-priority lane were then awarded contracts. The figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers, outside the lane.\n\nThe government says all leads were subject to the same eight-stage procurement process and the inbox helped identify credible offers more quickly.\n\nAlmost all the companies that won contracts via the preference lane remain unidentified.\n\nThe government has refused to say whether the deals Ms Ley brokered were placed in the so-called high priority lane.\n\nIt said it has no contracts with Life Partners Limited or Zoe Ley, adding the 90 million goggles and nine million gowns supplied by Worldlink were made available to NHS workers.\n\n\"We've been consistently clear that work was taking place at a time when global demand was greater than ever before and rapid action was required, so we had to work at an unprecedented pace to get supplies to the frontline,\" a government statement said.\n\n\"Stringent checks were in place on all contracts to guarantee quality, value for money and due diligence.\"\n\nWatch Panorama's Cashing in on Covid on BBC One at 19:35 GMT on Monday, 15 March, or later on the BBC iPlayer (UK only).",
