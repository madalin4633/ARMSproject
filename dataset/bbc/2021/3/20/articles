            "content": "\"I did a double take,\" said Cleopatra Browne of Welsh Marine Life Rescue\n\nA walrus has been spotted at the bottom of a Welsh cliff, just days after one was seen off the coast of Ireland.\n\nThe creature was seen near Broad Haven South beach, Pembrokeshire, on Friday before it managed to get back into the sea.\n\nIt is thought the animal may have been the same one that was seen off the County Kerry coast.\n\nCleopatra Browne of Welsh Marine Life Rescue was called to the scene where the walrus was \"sat there, chilling\".\n\n\"It was about the size of a cow,\" said Ms Browne, of St Davids, Pembrokeshire.\n\n\"It was a whopper. I've seen them on telly and the news but it was huge.\"\n\nShe said it looked \"underweight\" possibly because it had \"just swam miles across the ocean.\"\n\nWalruses are more often seen in the Arctic.\n\n\"I did a double take,\" Ms Browne said.\n\n\"You go around the coast path and go, 'woah'. It's not what you expect - it would be like seeing a penguin in your lounge.\"\n\nMs Browne watched the walrus from about 40m (130ft) away and believed it was a young animal as its tusks were \"about 3in long\".\n\n\"There is a tale going around that it fell asleep on an iceberg and ended up drifting across and woke up in Ireland,\" said Ms Browne.\n\n\"And then ended up in Wales on the way home.\"\n\nMs Browne's colleague Terry Leadbetter said: \"Hopefully he is heading toward Cornwall. It's been to Ireland and Wales.\"\n\nPhotographer Amy Compton said she \"couldn't believe\" what she was seeing, adding she had \"definitely\" not seen anything like it before.\n\nRSPCA animal rescue officer Ellie West, who checked the animal, said: \"He was resting and, although appearing slightly underweight, thankfully he wasn't displaying any signs of sickness or injury.\n\n\"This is an incredibly rare sighting and these big, beautiful animals never usually venture so far south. We believe this may be a juvenile who has travelled down this way in search of food.\"\n\nShe urged people to \"keep their distance\" and not approach the animal.\n\n\"I will certainly never forget this day, in fact it's still sinking in that I've been monitoring a walrus on the Pembrokeshire coast today,\" she said.\n\n\"It's been absolutely amazing. As a keen rugby fan, it's possibly the only reason I would miss the rugby.\"",

            "content": "Emma Homer said the attack had left her with \"anxiety, insomnia and stress\"\n\nA probationary police officer who assaulted a woman in a \"terrifying\" attack has been given a curfew, prompting criticism he was not jailed.\n\nWest Midlands Police PC Oliver Banfield grabbed and manhandled Emma Homer last July while drunk. He has been suspended and faces disciplinary action.\n\nThe investigating force has apologised for delays in the prosecution.\n\nLabour MP Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: \"Must have been terrifying for her... but no prison sentence.\"\n\nMs Homer said the attack had left her with \"anxiety, insomnia and stress\" and her family said they were \"disappointed\" with 25-year-old Banfield's sentence, a night-time curfew.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing at Leicester Magistrates' Court, CCTV was shown in which Banfield could be seen shouting at Ms Homer.\n\nHe is seen grabbing her and forcing her to the floor during the assault in the early hours of 26 July in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire.\n\nIn her victim personal statement which was read out in court, she said she thought he was \"fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy\".\n\nDescribing the assault, Ms Homer, 37, said: \"I often ask myself if the impact of the attack would have been so severe if my assailant was not a police officer.\n\n\"During the assault as I struggled to get to safety, I was sure this drunk man was fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy.\n\n\"To be verbally abused with misogynistic slang, grabbed by the neck, and forced to the floor on a dark road by a drunk man a foot taller than me is terrifying, but to then find that he was a police officer shook my belief system to its core.\"\n\nShe said: \"I considered myself a confident, relaxed, and independent wife and mother, but since the attack I live with constant anxiety.\n\n\"I have changed simple things like my route home, and I have had to ask my family not to discuss the case as it sends me into a panic attack - indeed whenever the subject is brought up I feel a rush of anxiety and a tightening at my throat.\"\n\nWarwickshire Police said it had personally apologised to Ms Homer for delays in the investigation.\n\nInitially the CPS said there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution. But after Ms Homer appealed, further inquiries were made and Banfield was charged.\n\nWarwickshire's Chief Superintendent Ben Smith said the force recognised \"the strength of feeling that has come about as a result of Sarah Everard's tragic death and understand the concerns relating to violence against women and girls nationally\".\n\nAnd he added: \"We acknowledge that, due to internal process errors, the initial response to the report of the assault was not as swift as it should have been and an apology has been issued with regards to this.\"\n\nBanfield pleaded guilty to assault by beating at a hearing in January and at Friday's hearing received a 14-week curfew order banning him from leaving his house between 19:00 and 07:00. He was also ordered to pay his victim \u00a3500 compensation as well as a victim surcharge and court costs.\n\nMs Homer's family said a night-time curfew during lockdown was \"not really a punishment at all\".\n\nCriticising the non-custodial sentence in a tweet, Ms Harman wrote: \"He continues in post. WMPolice (West Midlands Police) must review.\n\n\"This is proof, if any needed, that system fails women and protects men.\"\n\nIn a statement, West Midlands Police said Banfield, of Bidford-on-Avon, had been suspended from duty and would now face charges of gross misconduct.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine said: \"Our role is to protect the public, who should be able to trust us. We therefore hold all our officers to the highest standards and we will take appropriate action against anyone whose actions fall below what is expected.\"\n\nThe West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said he had asked Chief Constable Sir David Thompson to brief him on steps taken by the force.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "content": "When Tyrone and Alina stole a kiss in Friday's episode of Coronation Street, many viewers will have been rightly left wondering how they filmed it following social distancing guidelines.\n\nActors Alan Halsall and Ruxandra Porojnicu were filmed talking before their kiss, but did not get within two metres of one another, ITV bosses said.\n\nInstead, regular Corrie extra Alex Mulvaney and his wife Hannah then stepped in for the romantic moment.\n\n\"My agent said that Coronation Street needed extras who were in a support bubble, and because I used to be an extra three times a week and they knew half of my family had done extra work on the show, it worked out perfectly,\" explained Mulvaney.\n\n\"My partner Hannah hadn't done any extra work before, but my agent knew she had dark hair like Alina's so I asked her if she wanted to do it,\" he added.\n\nAlex Mulvaney and his wife Hannah are body doubles with a difference\n\n\"Hannah was nervous at first, but she is a big Coronation Street fan. I had been on set many times before, and I was able to talk her through what to expect - she was a bit star-struck when she saw the actors.\"\n\nLike most other shows, Coronation Street stopped filming during the first national lockdown in March 2020 and resumed filming in a restricted manner several months later.\n\nPorojnicu, who plays Alina, said the (non) kissing scene was a \"challenge\" but one she \"really enjoyed\".\n\nAlthough their characters look like they are sitting together, the actors were filmed having the conversation separately. The footage was composited together during post-production, giving the illusion they were next to each other.\n\nThe design department taped a pair of sunglasses onto a telescopic radio aerial to ensure the actors had the correct eye line, so they would appear to be looking into each other's eyes.\n\n\"It was difficult not being able to look into each other's eyes for the emotion of the scene but Coronation Street came up with a clever way to cheat that with sunglasses on an aerial,\" the actress said.\n\n\"Everything that's been said in the scene leads to the kiss which is very important for Alina because it is the first time that she has said out loud to Tyrone that she is falling for him.\"\n\nProducer Iain MacLeod praised the popular programme's writers, cast and crew for having \"cleverly worked around\" restrictions, for the best part of a difficult year.\n\nWhen the characters Debbie and Kevin were trapped in a fridge, the actors were tested for Covid beforehand and were placed in a bubble for the three days of filming, as were Alya, Yasmeen and Geoff for the dramatic rooftop scenes for the 60th anniversary show in December.\n\n\"We have therefore told the same stories throughout the pandemic that we would have told in 'normal' times,\" said MacLeod.\n\n\"But it just felt wrong to tell a story of an illicit liaison, where someone betrays their partner based on lust and sexual attraction, only for us not to see any of the chemistry and closeness.\n\n\"Hence the smoke and mirrors here.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

            "content": "Covid: Changing school terms 'would help pupils catch up'\n\nThere has been a phased return to school for pupils in Wales after they were closed during lockdown\n\nPermanently changing term times and school hours could help pupils to catch up on teaching missed during the pandemic, a leading academic says.\n\nSchool hours could be condensed into four longer days to give time for extra support, said Gareth Evans, of the University of Wales Trinity St David.\n\nHe added shorter summer holidays could also help children from more disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe education minister said there are no current plans to change term dates.\n\nBut Mr Evans, director of education policy, argued more should be done to capitalise on lower Covid rates in the summer.\n\n\"The infection rates are likely to remain around for some time and Covid is not going to go away,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can repackage school term times to accommodate a slightly shorter summer break and a slightly longer Christmas break, I think that will do us no harm in terms of mitigating Covid.\n\n\"There's also a very key educational reason for doing this, we know that learners don't benefit from a six-week break over the summer period.\n\n\"It's not natural to break learning up for that long and children from more disadvantaged backgrounds tend to suffer the most.\"\n\nAll pupils are expected to return to the classroom after Easter, following a phased return and months of remote learning.\n\nMr Evans said tweaking the hours of the school week could also help schools find extra time for catch-up work or for teacher and pupil well-being.\n\n\"I think these are extreme circumstances and they demand radical and innovative responses,\" he said.\n\n\"An asymmetric week - or a four-day school week as it's sometimes known - is also something that we should definitely explore.\n\n\"Schools can have a reduction in break times and start slightly earlier to accommodate them having an earlier finish on a Friday, or an afternoon off here and there to support more bespoke individual learning and catch-up.\"\n\nMr Evans said that if school hours were mostly condensed into four longer days, then it could also allow learners and staff to make up for lost time in other parts of life.\n\n\"I think what it could do is create more time for independent learning, more time for one-to-one learning support and give pupils the chance to spend more time catching up socially with their peers and at home with their families,\" he added.\n\n\"I think we'll be doing very much the right thing by our learners and supporting school staff as well, because let's not forget that they have been through an awful lot this past year themselves. They will need time to recover and repair.\"\n\nDafydd Trystan, who previously sat on the independent panel tasked with \"re-imagining schooling\" by the Welsh government, agreed that the pandemic presented an opportunity to change the system.\n\n\"We have a pattern of schooling in Wales today that is based on 19th Century practices,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's high time we at least reach the 20th Century, I hope for the 21st Century.\n\n\"I think by looking at the school day, certainly at school terms, there's a way to do that.\n\n\"Potentially you could reduce the length of the summer holidays which are a challenge for parents, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n\"Maybe you have six terms with gaps of two to four weeks between them.\"\n\nUK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson previously said longer school days and shorter holidays were being looked at there.\n\nHowever, Mary van den Heuvel, from the National Education Union Cymru, said it was \"unhelpful and a distraction\" to consider changing school patterns when some pupils had not yet had the chance for a full return to school.\n\n\"What we've really got to remember is that children and young people have had a really difficult year too,\" she said.\n\n\"Any kind of focus on catch-up is going to really be about ensuring their well-being is supported.\n\n\"I think it's really difficult to judge how long we're looking at in terms of catch-up.\n\n\"I think we are going to need to see some support over the summer, but we've already got things like SHEP (School Holiday Enrichment Programme) which is obviously an enrichment programme to support children and young people.\"\n\nMs van den Heuvel said one option could be to pay local authorities to provide extra support during the holidays, using staff who are \"able to work over the summer and who aren't desperate for a break because they've been working really incredibly long hours\".\n\nMeanwhile, there have been calls to \"scale-up\" opportunities for children to take part in sports and arts activities over the summer.\n\nThe children's commissioner for Wales, the Urdd and Sport Wales all argue there needs to be \"a stronger emphasis\" on holiday activities for children.\n\nA spokesperson for the Welsh government said: \"There will be no changes to term dates this academic year.\n\n\"However, the minister has a long-standing view that we should consider long-term changes to the rhythm of the academic year to address issues such as learning loss, improved opportunities for community activities and shorter terms to support pupil and teacher well-being.\n\n\"She established a panel to review this, and hopes that work can restart soon.\"",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Thousands of people have attended anti-lockdown demonstrations in London, after MPs urged the government to allow peaceful protest during lockdown.\n\nCrowds marched from Hyde Park to Westminster, with at least 33 arrests by police, mostly for Covid breaches.\n\nScotland Yard said the number of people attending Saturday's demonstrations exceeded expectations.\n\nThe Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend protests under the current coronavirus rules.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told the BBC more people than previously expected were at Saturday's protests, but the Met has not given a formal estimate of the number in attendance.\n\nBBC correspondent Marianna Spring, reporting from the anti-lockdown protests, said the atmosphere was \"animated\" and a number of people appeared to be angry about restrictions on peaceful protest.\n\nLater, in Hyde Park, police officers were forced to run back to their vans, as protesters threw bottles and cans at them.\n\nPA Media reported that some members of the public then left the park, with small children carried by their parents.\n\nThe anti-lockdown protests came after a vigil following the death of Sarah Everard in south London last week resulted in arrests, as police enforced Covid and public order laws.\n\nEarlier, more than 60 MPs and peers wrote to the home secretary calling for laws to be changed to allow peaceful protests during lockdown.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey blamed the scenes at the Clapham event on a lack of clarity putting police \"in an impossible position\", adding that the right to protest was a \"basic freedom\".\n\nThousands of tightly-packed anti-lockdown protesters marched up Whitehall with some chanting \"freedom\" to the beat of a drum.\n\nOne man carried a placard bearing the words \"no more NHS and Gov lies\".\n\nI have seen very few demonstrators wearing masks and there's no attempt at social distancing. So far the police - who are here in large numbers - have been taking a hands-off approach, though I have seen at least one arrest on Whitehall.\n\nAmong the crowd there are undoubtedly some conspiracy theorists, with some accusing the mainstream media of pushing fake news. But that is by no means everyone here.\n\nOne woman, who did not want to be named, told me she knew Covid was bad. \"I had it myself last March,\" she said. \"But this lockdown is too much.\"\n\nThe letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, urged her to issue guidance to police forces on \"facilitating\" protests.\n\nThe initial organisers of the Sarah Everard vigil effectively lost a High Court battle to hold it lawfully the day before, resulting in its cancellation.\n\nBut hundreds attended Clapham Common to gather around tributes left on a bandstand - the Met Police said the gathering became unlawful after people began delivering speeches to the crowd.\n\nThe event also increased interest in plans to give officers more precise powers to restrict demonstrations in a new sweeping Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill debated by MPs.\n\nSir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, told MPs earlier this month that protests elsewhere had not resulted in a spike in infections and that outdoor gatherings were safer than indoors, though not risk free.\n\nHe said: \"It is the case that it is difficult to see how things like large beach gatherings and so on can cause a spike. The same was the case in a protest march in New York; they did not really see any spikes after that.\n\n\"It is lower risk, but the other thing that can happen with outdoor events, and so on, is that, when indoor things are also open, you start to get people congregating indoors around that. That can increase risk, but outdoors itself is lower risk.\"",

The gas emissions will be monitored closely,\" the IMO said.\n\nThe IMO said the eruption of Fagradalsfjall began at about 20:45 GMT on Friday, and was later confirmed via webcams and satellite images.\n\nA coastguard helicopter was sent to survey the area, about 30km (19 miles) from Reykjavik.\n\nIt then sent first images of the lava snaking its way down after the eruption.\n\n\"I can see the glowing red sky from my window,\" said Rannveig Gudmundsdottir, who lives in Grindavik, 8 km (5 miles) from the eruption.\n\nA magnitude 3.1 earthquake was recorded 1.2 km from Fagradalsfjall just several hours earlier.\n\nIceland frequently experiences tremors as it straddles two tectonic plates, which are drifting in opposite directions.",

            "section": "World",
            "content": "Wealthy countries - including the UK - are blocking proposals to help developing nations increase their vaccine manufacturing capabilities, documents leaked to BBC Newsnight show.\n\nSeveral poorer countries have asked the World Health Organization to help them.\n\nBut richer nations are pushing back on provisions in international law that would enable them to achieve this.\n\nThis is according to a leaked copy of the negotiating text of a WHO resolution on the issue.\n\nAmong those richer nations are the UK, the US, as well as the European Union.\n\n\"Where we could have language in there that would make it easier for countries to produce more vaccines and more medicines within their country, it would include initiatives that would finance and facilitate that. The UK is on the opposite side of the argument of trying to remove those kinds of progressive proposals from the text,\" says Diarmaid McDonald, from Just Treatment, a patient group for fair access to medicines.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK government says \"a global pandemic requires a global solution and the UK is leading from the front, driving forward efforts to ensure equitable access around the world to Covid vaccines and treatments\".\n\nThe spokesperson says the UK is one of the largest donors to international efforts to ensure over one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines get to developing countries this year.\n\nIf and when governments should intervene to ensure affordable supplies of medicines is a long-standing issue.\n\nBut the ability of different countries to source vaccines and drugs has been highlighted by the pandemic.\n\nMany experts say equitable access to vaccines is essential to prevent cases and deaths and to contribute to global population immunity.\n\nBut the global capacity for producing vaccines is about a third of what is needed, says Ellen t'Hoen, an expert in medicines policy and intellectual property law.\n\n\"These are vaccines that are produced in wealthy countries and are in general kept by those wealthy countries.\n\n\"Developing nations are saying we need to have a share of the pie, not only the share of the vaccines, but also the share of the right to produce these vaccines,\" she adds.\n\nTo make a vaccine you not only need to have the right to produce the actual substance they are composed of (which is protected by patents), you also need to have the knowledge about how to make them because the technology can be complex.\n\nThe WHO does not have the authority to sidestep patents - but it is trying to bring countries together to find a way to bolster vaccine supplies.\n\nThe discussions include using provisions in international law to get around patents and helping countries to have the technical ability to make them.\n\nBut the drug industry argues that eroding patents would hinder its ability to invest in future treatments for Covid and other illnesses.\n\nEarlier this month, representatives of the US drug industry wrote to US President Joe Biden to share their concerns.\n\n\"Eliminating those protections would undermine the global response to the pandemic,\" they wrote, including ongoing efforts to tackle new variants.\n\nIt would also create confusion that could potentially undermine public confidence in vaccine safety, and create a barrier to information sharing, the representatives said.\n\n\"Most importantly, eliminating protections would not speed up production,\" they added.\n\nOthers agree. Anne Moore, an expert in vaccine immunology, worries about what impact undermining patents will have on future research.\n\n\"Over time we see fewer and fewer organisations and commercial companies being in the vaccine field because there's so little return on it,\" she says.\n\nDrug companies point out they have also donated financially and given medicines to help tackle the pandemic.\n\nBut campaigners argue that about \u00a390bn ($125bn) of public money has gone into developing Covid treatments and vaccines so the public should have a stake. Once the pandemic ends, there is a lot of money to be made, they say.\n\n\"It's obvious that there are longer-term plans to increase the price of these vaccines once the most urgent phase of the pandemic is over. So that is another reason why developing countries are saying we need to gain the ability to produce these vaccines ourselves now,\" Ms t'Hoen says.",

Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April.\n\nThe most-recent issues with supplies meant the vaccine rollout would be \"slightly slower than we might have hoped but not slower than the target we had set ourselves\", Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Friday.\n\nThose with appointments for second doses should attend as normal and it is expected April could see more second doses than first doses for the first time.\n\nAlongside the Oxford vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the UK has also approved a third vaccine - from Moderna - which is due to start being rolled out in late spring.\n\nA vaccine from Novavax has shown promising results and will be made in north-east England, and a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson has also been shown to be effective.",

            "content": "Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the move will be a \"very serious breach of the devolution settlement\"\n\nA move by the UK government to compel Stormont to implement abortion laws will have \"serious consequences for devolution\", a DUP MP has said.\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson said it would be a \"very serious breach of the devolution settlement\".\n\nWestminster is planning to give Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis new powers to take such action.\n\nNorthern Ireland's abortion laws changed last March after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution.\n\nSpeaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, the DUP leader in the House of Commons, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the action should be a concern even for those who support the provision of abortion services.\n\nHe said people \"should recognise the danger of what the secretary of state is doing here\" and \"if he can do it on this, then it could happen on many other areas\".\n\nBBC News NI understands that Northern Ireland's attorney general advised the Stormont executive that commissioning abortion services could be regarded as a controversial matter under the terms of the ministerial code.\n\nThe code states issues which are \"significant or controversial\" must be brought to the executive.\n\nSome Stormont parties had been calling on Health Minister Robin Swann to commission the services.\n\nBut he has maintained that it requires the support of the whole executive.\n\nIt is believed Attorney General Brenda King gave the advice to Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, who asked her whether Mr Swann was required to get approval of the executive before setting up abortion services through the Department of Health.\n\nIt is understood Ms King's view was that if Mr Swann acted without consensus of the full executive, there was a risk of a legal challenge.\n\nA statement issued earlier by the Department of Health reflected this, and stated that Mr Swann's position was that the issue of abortion services was controversial and required the support of the whole executive.\n\n\"He does not believe that a ministerial decision to commission and fund abortion services would be defensible in court in the absence of executive approval,\" it added.\n\nWhile the law was passed last March, commissioning of full services has been stalled due to differences within the five-party executive.\n\nThis latest development, first reported by the Guardian, will see the NI secretary lay new regulations in Parliament early next week.\n\nThe move will let him direct Northern Ireland's Department of Health to commission the services.\n\nStormont and Westminster are also facing legal action from the Human Rights Commission over the delay.\n\nThe law changes meant abortion laws in Northern Ireland altered significantly last year, with terminations available in all circumstances of the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIt is legal in other circumstances up to 24 weeks and beyond that for cases of non-fatal fetal disabilities and fatal fetal abnormalities.\n\nAlliance Party assembly member (MLA) Paula Bradshaw said the responsibility for providing abortion services lay with the health minister.\n\nShe said he had the power, responsibility and legal duty to provide a \"comprehensive framework for our healthcare professionals to operate within\".\n\nMs Bradshaw said while she believed in devolution, she welcomed the intervention of the NI secretary.\n\nAgriculture Minister Edwin Poots, of the DUP, wrote on social media the UK government \"would do well to listen to first minister on this issue\" and that there was anger among assembly members at \"this act of destruction on the devolution settlement\".\n\nInteresting that Sinn Fein are wanting Westminster laws imposed against the wishes of the Assembly.\n\nHMG would do well to listen to FM on this issue, there is a lot of anger amongst MLAs at this act of destruction on the devolution settlement. \u2014 Edwin Poots MLA (@edwinpootsmla) March 18, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Steve Aiken, said the \"controversial\" issue of abortion should be dealt with by the whole executive.\n\n\"Any unilateral decision by the health minister to commission and fund new abortion services without executive approval would be a breach of the Northern Ireland Act and the Ministerial Code,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it was \"deeply regrettable that some political parties are seeking to score points on such a sensitive issue\".\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a \"matter of regret\" the executive had not been able to \"commission services in line with its legal obligations\".\n\n\"The SDLP has been warning for weeks that this British government has shown no restraint when it comes to interfering with the devolution settlement,\" he said.\n\nMs Hargey said it was \"unfortunate and unnecessary\" that the action was not able to be taken locally.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said the \"executive as a whole, and certainly those parties who are blocking the commissioning of these services, need to be implementing them as soon as possible\".\n\nShe said she had unsuccessfully tried to have the issue placed on the agenda for the executive last week, and would try again for next week.\n\nThe Church of Ireland said the move was \"unjustified\" now Stormont was sitting again.\n\nArchbishop of Armagh John McDowell said it was \"clearly a devolved matter\".\n\nThe Presbyterian Church said it would \"seriously undermine\" devolution and called on Mr Lewis to withdraw the proposal.\n\nAt present health trusts are carrying out interim services for early medical abortions up to 10 weeks, meaning women seeking a termination beyond that are required to travel to England.\n\nThe DUP, which opposed the changes to the abortion laws by Westminster, has proposed a piece of legislation at Stormont seeking to restrict abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\n\nIt passed its second reading on Monday with the support of a number of parties.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in abstained on that vote but has separately called for the Department of Health to commission full abortion services as required under the regulations.\n\nThe Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists view the issue as a matter of conscience for individual assembly members.",

She is savvy and sensible, it's not like her at all, it just doesn't add up,\" he said.\n\nMs Heslop, originally from Southampton, went for dinner with Mr Bane on Sunday 7 March, before returning to catamaran Siren Song and going to bed.\n\nHer bank cards and mobile phone were still on board when she vanished.\n\nVirgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) spokesman Toby Derima said officers had performed an \"initial land search\" after speaking with Mr Bane and had instructed him to contact the US coastguard.\n\n\"Soon after reporting Ms Heslop missing, Mr Bane acquired the services of an attorney,\" he said.\n\n\"Upon his attorney's advice, Mr Bane exercised his constitutional right to remain silent and denied officers' requests to search the vessel.\"\n\nMr Baldwin, one among several of Ms Heslop's friends who has urged police to carry out an \"urgent\" search of the catamaran, said they couldn't understand why Mr Bane's lawyer had denied officers' requests to search the boat.\n\nFriends said she had been staying aboard Siren Song for a couple of weeks\n\nMs Heslop's family has said they will \"never give up looking for Sarm and still have hope of finding her safe\".\n\nFriends in the UK have set up a Missing Sarm Heslop Facebook page to share information about her disappearance.\n\nVirgin Islands Police Department said officers remained \"committed to locating Ms Heslop\", and investigations continue.\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

He said an exhibition centre had also been suggested.\n\n\"A lot of people don't know what she did,\" he said. \"She came from an ordinary background like myself in the East End of London.\n\n\"She had tough times and hard times and she was always down-to-earth - never grand, and always kind and generous.\n\n\"These days, many celebrities are grand and remote but Vera was never like that. And she never forgot the sacrifices made by the troops in the Second World War.\"\n\nThe memorial, which also has the support of Dover MP Natalie Elphicke, is to be paid for by donations and public subscription.\n\nLast year, as the country went into coronavirus lockdown, Dame Vera, who lived in Ditchling, Sussex, compared the challenges that lay ahead to \"the darkest of times\" in World War Two. She used her birthday and VE Day to give messages of hope.\n\nOn VE Day, she quoted from her most well-known song and said: \"We will meet again.\"\n\nThe wartime song had also been echoed by the Queen in a special televised address in April - when she acknowledged the hardship Britons were facing during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nAn image of Dame Vera was projected on to the White Cliffs after she died last year\n\nDame Vera, the daughter of a plumber, was born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917 in the London suburb of East Ham, and discovered her talent for singing at an early age.\n\nHer stage name, Vera Lynn, came from her grandmother's maiden name.\n\nLater, when she volunteered for war work, she was told the best thing she could do was to keep on being an entertainer.\n\nFollowing her death, tributes from around the world included Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing her as a \"truly great Briton\".\n\nA promotional video to be released next week will include contributions from Katherine Jenkins, Sir Tim Rice, Sir Paul McCartney and Anthony Andrews.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has said she stands by \"every word\" of her evidence to the Alex Salmond committee amid renewed pressure from political opponents.\n\nA spokesperson for the first minister accused the committee of politically-motivated smears and rejected some of the findings which have emerged from the unpublished report.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives have called for Ms Sturgeon to resign.\n\nThe committee's convener has expressed \"dismay\" at the leaks to the media.\n\nThe full report is due to be published on Tuesday.\n\nThose parts which are critical of Ms Sturgeon were agreed by five votes to four, with the SNP members on the cross-party committee voting against.\n\nThe committee said it was \"hard to believe\" that Ms Sturgeon did not know of concerns of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Salmond before November 2017 - which is when she says she was first alerted to any issues.\n\nThe BBC understands that the report will say that if Ms Sturgeon did have such knowledge, then she should have acted upon it.\n\nThe report also concluded that Ms Sturgeon gave an \"inaccurate account\" of what happened when she met Mr Salmond at her home on 2 April 2018, and had misled the committee.\n\nAnd the committee said it was concerned that Ms Sturgeon did not notify the government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, about that meeting until 6 June 2018.\n\nThe report says: \"She should have made the permanent secretary aware as soon as possible after the 2 April 2018 meeting, at which point she should have confirmed she would cease contact with Alex Salmond.\"\n\nThe report is also expected to be highly critical of Ms Evans.\n\nA spokesperson for the first minister said on Friday that she had told the truth to the committee, and stood by \"every word of her evidence\".\n\nThe spokesperson said the suggestion that the committee had found it \"hard to believe\" that she did not previously know about allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Salmond was \"not supported by a single shred of evidence\".\n\n\"On this, the committee appears to have resorted to baseless assertion, supposition and smear - that is not how serious parliamentary committees are supposed to work, and in behaving this way they are simply exposing their base political motives,\" said the statement.\n\nThe spokesperson also accused the committee of ignoring and suppressing evidence which supported Ms Sturgeon's evidence that she told Mr Salmond in April 2018 that she would not intervene on his behalf.\n\nHowever, the Scottish Conservatives say that if the first minister does not resign by Tuesday, they will seek to hold a vote of no confidence in her on Wednesday.\n\nThe party's Holyrood leader Ruth Davidson said: \"If Nicola Sturgeon has a shred of integrity, she should be considering her position. She has every opportunity to do the right thing and resign.\n\n\"No first minister is above the fundamental principles of honesty and trust. There is no question that Nicola Sturgeon has misled parliament and broken the promises she made to tell the truth.\n\n\"The SNP's erratic outburst today against the committee shows the panicked spiral they are now in.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would not \"prejudge\" the outcome of the report\n\nBut he said that if the report found the first minister had misled parliament, and potentially broken the ministerial code, then it would be \"incredibly serious\".\n\n\"The code itself is clear, if the code has been breached the individual should resign,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the process had \"turned into a complete farce\", with \"party politics over-riding the public interest\".\n\nWithin a week, Holyrood will be on a break for the election and a six-week campaign for votes will be under way.\n\nWe know there will be arguments over coronavirus recovery and indyref2, but there will also be another major theme: truth and trust.\n\nThat debate will feed off the two reports due in the next few days on the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond.\n\nWhen the Holyrood committee publishes its findings on Tuesday, we know the opposition majority will conclude that Nicola Sturgeon gave them a misleading account, which the first minister denies.\n\nA separate independent investigation by Ireland's former prosecution chief, James Hamilton, will decide whether or not the first minister broke conduct rules and recommend sanctions, if required.\n\nThe Conservatives have already decided Ms Sturgeon lied to parliament and should resign, and they intend to hold a vote of no confidence in her on Wednesday if she does not quit.\n\nWith the continued support of the Scottish Greens, the first minister can survive what she regards as a nakedly political attempt to oust her and let the public decide whether she should remain in office.\n\nThere has never been a Holyrood election campaign curtain-raiser anything like this.\n\nThe committee's convener, SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, expressed her anger that \"accounts of the conclusions of the draft report\" had been leaked to the media.\n\n\"I am dismayed by the damage this may do to the value of the committee's work, which I have long hoped would improve the treatment of the complainers of sexual harassment,\" she said.\n\n\"The selective leaking of particular committee recommendations has shifted the focus away from these goals, and the recommendations which seek to achieve it, and onto party political terrain which will likely frustrate, not assist, the women at the heart of this.\"\n\nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants.\n\nThe former first minister was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses following a judicial review, and was subsequently acquitted of sexual assault charges in a High Court trial.\n\nA separate inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code is being carried out by James Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer. He is also expected to publish his report in the coming days.",

            "content": "Covid weddings: 'No light at end of tunnel' for wedding businesses\n\nClaire Vessey and David McQueen said they were keen to marry after a difficult year\n\nWedding businesses say there is \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" and are relying on personal savings to survive.\n\nCouples who have planned, cancelled, then re-planned their special day say they are hoping to say \"I do\" instead of \"what can I do?\" as lockdown eases.\n\nBut with no date set for wedding receptions, there remains confusion over whether plans for 2021 will fall foul of future guidelines.\n\nThe Welsh government said the law had changed to expand the range of venues.\n\nA week ago First Minister Mark Drakeford set out how various sectors in society would be reopened - like non-essential shops, hairdressers and outdoor sports - but weddings were not mentioned in his plans.\n\nOn Friday the Welsh government said as long as case rates remained low and vaccination numbers continued, weddings would be \"considered\" from 22 April.\n\nAt present receptions are banned and the number of ceremony guests depends on how many people from different households a venue can safely keep 2m apart.\n\nKris Agland, managing director of venue St Paul's Hall in Cardiff, said the guidance around weddings was \"being handled appallingly\" and called for more dialogue between the hospitality industry and those in power.\n\n\"There's no clear guidance. It's been a kind of one-size-fits-all approach,\" he said.\n\n\"Come and see what we're doing - do you feel safe? Why can't someone from the trade be part of their conversations?\"\n\nPhotographer Mary Watler-Thomas said her hours had been cut for weddings because receptions could not be held\n\nHe said he spent about \u00a310,000 making Covid-compliant additions to the venue, which usually hosts 50 to 60 wedding receptions each year.\n\n\"No-one will book anything until they know what the guidance is,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything is based on what-ifs. Financially as a business it's crippled it. Personally, it's just got me further and further into debt just like everybody else who owns hospitality businesses.\n\n\"When things do come back they're going to come back with such a boom that you've got to see yourselves through to that position. But at what stage do people say, 'well I can't see it through'?\"\n\nWedding photographer Mary Watler-Thomas, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said some ceremonies had been \"surreal\", including couples being told to wear masks during the ceremony.\n\n\"Last year I was set to cover 20 [weddings] but I had quite a few postponed so ended up doing 10. But this year I'm set to do 27, fingers crossed,\" she said.\n\n\"When people want to postpone they're worried they won't be able to have all their guests there, they want to postpone but I'm not available for their new date.\n\n\"Because they haven't given a date for hospitality [couples are] reducing the day to just the ceremony. I've had to reduce the time to two hours where I used to cover 12 hours so it's had a massive impact on income because you're reducing the day by 10 hours.\n\n\"There's been so much confusion... a lot of questions in the minds of those planning what it'll look like in Wales, so it would be very helpful to have a roadmap in Wales.\"\n\nClaire Vessey's mother Maureen died at the start of the first lockdown\n\nClaire Vessey, 46, from Treboeth, Swansea, and her fianc\u00e9e David McQueen, 54, from Morriston, have been together for nine years and put off getting married while caring for Claire's elderly mum, Maureen.\n\nWhen Maureen, 86, died at the start of the first lockdown, the couple - who had previously had a blessing at the Sacred Heart church in Swansea - decided to make her dream come true.\n\n\"The wedding would be one thing she would want us to do,\" said Ms Vessey, an administration manager for fire protection services.\n\n\"Us being happy together, that's what she would have loved.\n\n\"We incorporated what she would want too, so we can feel like she's there. She loved butterflies so that's part of our theme. She's a massive part of the day.\"\n\nBut Covid restrictions meant the couple had to plan for various outcomes. They still have not confirmed their guest list.\n\n\"We booked it for 15 May. It has been so hard with all the restrictions and so many obstacles put in our way,\" said Ms Vessey.\n\n\"It's like we have been planning two weddings. One for original plans - church wedding with a late reception - and also back-up plans if restrictions do not lift, which is looking like what we will have to go with.\n\n\"But these plans are all still not confirmed. Everything is up in the air and the weeks are flying by - we never thought it would be so stressful.\"\n\nDespite the stress, the couple said there were benefits to keeping the wedding simple.\n\nMs Vessey said: \"When people planned weddings in the past, they planned this big wedding with all these people, but when you break it down it's about two people that really love each other. He's my first real boyfriend and my first love.\n\n\"It's about David and I now. We've concentrated on what's important for us two, which is what it's really about.\"\n\nBridal boutique owner Helen Pembridge said brides were \"desperate\" to buy dresses in case there was another lockdown\n\nIn Scotland, wedding receptions - but without alcohol - can take place with up to 50 people from 26 April.\n\nWedding ceremonies in Northern Ireland are currently limited to 25 people and receptions are banned. But dates for lockdown easing reviews are set for 15 April, 13 May and 10 June.\n\nFrom 29 March in England, weddings can be attended by a maximum of six people. This will rise to 15 after 12 April if Covid rates remain low, increasing to a limit of 30 after 17 May. Receptions are included in the plans, but only in certain venues.\n\nHelen Pembridge, who runs a bridal boutique in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, said many brides who had already had to cancel appointments three or four times were \"desperate\" to get dresses in case there was another lockdown.\n\n\"Brides I'm getting calls from are not even getting married until October 2022, but they want to get their dresses now because they're afraid they won't be able to if we have to shut again for a couple of months,\" she said.\n\nThe Welsh government has already set out different rules for weddings at different alert levels.\n\nAt alert level four, for instance, receptions are banned but at alert level two a maximum of 30 people can attend an indoors reception and 50 outdoors, and venues are still subject to any additional rules set at that time on hospitality.\n\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We know many couples have made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding because of the ongoing pandemic.\n\n\"The current restrictions allow for the legal marriage ceremony to take place and we have changed the law to expand the range of venues where ceremonies can be performed.\n\n\"These are challenging times for everyone, especially those working in the events and hospitality sector, but with everyone's help, better times are ahead of us.\"",

            "content": "More than 60 MPs and peers have written to the home secretary calling for a change in Covid-19 legislation to allow protests to happen during lockdown.\n\nThe letter, organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, says there is a human right to protest.\n\nUnder England's current lockdown regulations, protests are not listed as a \"reasonable excuse\" for leaving home.\n\nIt comes as further protests are planned for Saturday by anti-lockdown campaigners.\n\nThe Home Office said it was still illegal for people to attend protests at a time when regulations that are in place to prevent wide transmission of Covid require people to stay at home at all times, except for a limited number of exceptions.\n\nLast weekend, police were criticised for arresting women attending a vigil following the killing of Sarah Everard.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to \"conduct a lessons-learned review into the policing of the event\".\n\nA day earlier, campaigners attempted, without success, to persuade the High Court that the vigil should be exempt from the coronavirus regulations.\n\nThe judge hearing the case decided not to intervene but did suggest that the human rights of expression and gathering might be considered reasonable excuses in some circumstances.\n\nThe letter to Ms Patel was signed by several Conservative MPs - including Steve Baker, and Sir Christopher Chope - as well as Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and a number of Labour MPs and peers.\n\nIt demands that the home secretary issue guidance to police forces on \"facilitating\" protests to clear up the legal confusion surrounding the issue.\n\nIt calls on Ms Patel to act in order to avoid a situation where organisers and the police have to \"decipher precisely what is required\".\n\n\"The absence of clear guidance on these issues has created an entirely unsatisfactory situation, which has persisted to varying degrees for almost a year now,\" the letter says.\n\n\"The police have no legal certainty as to their duties and powers, protestors have no legal certainty as to their rights, and there is inconsistent application of the Regulations across the country. This cannot continue,\" the letter adds.\n\nIn response, the Home Office maintained its position that it would be illegal to to leave home without a reasonable excuse until coronavirus rules change on 29 March.\n\nIt added: \"While we are still in a pandemic we continue to urge people to avoid mass gatherings, in line with wider coronavirus restrictions.\"\n\nReacting to reports of more protests planned this weekend, the Metropolitan Police said a \"significant policing operation\" would be in place throughout the day to \"engage\" with people who are in breach of the regulations.\n\nIt added: \"Those gathering will be encouraged to return home. If they do not they face necessary and proportionate enforcement action. This could be a fixed penalty notice or arrest.\"\n\nThe legal confusion grew following last week's Court of Appeal case - during which the force appeared to accept that it did not have a policy of blanket bans on protests, because that would breach human rights.\n\nHowever, when those attending the vigil in memory of the 33-year-old marketing executive surrounded a bandstand on Clapham Common, a decision was taken to attempt to remove them.\n\nThere were confrontations with the police and arrests were made.\n\nSilkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, said: \"The harrowing scenes of police officers using force against women at Clapham Common recently were avoidable and wrong. Over the past week, many more demonstrators and even legal observers have been arrested or fined.\n\n\"This stain on our democracy is a direct consequence of this government's disrespect for the most basic of British democratic freedoms.\"\n\nSam Grant from Liberty said: \"Last week, the police conceded protest is not banned under the lockdown regulations, but used them to threaten then arrest demonstrators anyway.\n\n\"The home secretary must immediately issue guidance to all police forces to ensure socially distanced protests can go ahead and create an explicit exemption for protest in the current regulations.\"",

            "section": "India",
            "content": "A sanitation worker became the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine as the country began the world's largest inoculation drive.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme, which aims to vaccinate more than 1.3 billion people against Covid.\n\nHe paid tribute to front-line workers who will be the first to receive jabs.\n\nIndia has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the United States.\n\nMillions of doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - were shipped across the country in the days leading up to the start of the drive.\n\n\"We are launching the world's biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,\" Mr Modi, said, addressing the country on Saturday morning.\n\nA sanitation worker is the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine\n\nHe added that India was well prepared to vaccinate its population with the help of an app, which would help the government track the drive and ensure that nobody was left out.\n\nMr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers \"who showed us the light\" in \"dark times\".\n\n\"They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers - this is our way of paying respect to them.\"\n\nDoctors and medical staff at Delhi's Max hospital tell me a lot of hope is being pinned on the vaccination drive. One official described it \"as a new dawn\" and said \"it's the beginning of Covid's end\".\n\nInside the waiting room, there are posters on the wall with information about the documents one needs to bring, how safe the vaccine is, and the precautions that need to be taken even after one's been vaccinated. Among those being vaccinated on Saturday are doctors, nurses and front-office staff from all departments.\n\nThe names have been been chosen alphabetically so those getting jabs are mostly those with names starting with the letter A.\n\n\"The pandemic has played havoc in the country. I hope the vaccine will rid us of the fears and we will be able to breathe easy,\" Dr Anil Dass said after getting the jab.\n\nAshutosh Chaturvedi, a 31-year-old male nurse described as a \"Covid warrior\" by hospital officials, became the first recipient of the vaccine at Max.\n\n\"I'm fine, I feel good,\" he told reporters as he came down the hospital ramp, which has been decorated with blue, green and white balloons.\n\nSince April, he told me, he's worked in the emergency wing of the Covid ward, tending to those afflicted with the coronavirus.\n\n\"I haven't seen my wife and nine-month-old daughter since then. A month later, once I've received the second dose, I'll visit my family,\" he said.\n\nMr Modi also appealed to people to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and following social distancing. He said the country cannot afford to be complacent as vaccinating the entire population will take time.\n\nHe also urged people not to believe any \"propaganda and rumours about the safety of the vaccines\".\n\n\"I want to tell people that the approval to these vaccines was given only after scientists and experts were satisfied about its safety,\" he said.\n\nAn estimated 10 million health workers will be vaccinated in the first round, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front-line workers.\n\nHealth workers have been queuing up at vaccination centres for their turn\n\nNext in line will be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions. India's electoral rolls, which contain details of some 900 million voters, will be used to identify eligible recipients.\n\nThe government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. This will happen in state-run health care centres, schools, colleges, community halls, municipal offices and wedding halls.\n\nSeveral hospitals across India are giving the first doses of the vaccine.\n\nDr Atul Peters was among those who got the jab at Max hospital.\n\n\"It's a very big day. I'm grateful to those who worked hard to make this a reality. I was very very happy when I got a call informing me that my name was on the list.\n\n\"We worked hard during the pandemic to save lives and we are also taking the jab first to dispel fears in people's minds that the vaccine is not safe,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMillions of vaccine doses have been shipped across India\n\nIndia's drug regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally-made by pharma company Bharat Biotech.\n\nBut concerns have been raised over the efficacy of Covaxin because the regulator's emergency approval came before the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. The regulator and the manufacturer have said the vaccine is safe, and that the efficacy data would be available by February.\n\nBoth vaccines will be given as two injections, 28 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity would begin to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect 14 days after the second dose.\n\nThe status of the vaccines and recipients will be electronically tracked in real time - some 8 million people who will receive the early jabs have been already registered. More than 600,000 people have been trained for the drive.\n\nThe jabs will be voluntary, and recipients will be given a certificate of vaccination after they complete both doses.\n\n\"I expect India's vaccination programme will be run much better than most countries because of the considerable government investment and early preparedness,\" Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts, told the BBC.\n\nWith more than 10 million cases, India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US.\n\nThe largest vaccination drive in the country, however, begins at a time when infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal. A limited availability of doses in the initial phase, therefore, is not likely to pose a problem.\n\nMost scientists feel India is primed for the challenge as it is a vaccine-making powerhouse and has run, for decades, a well-oiled immunisation programme for tens of millions of new-borns and mothers-to-be.\n\nBut the real challenges will begin when the general population starts receiving the jabs.\n\nIndia will use its formidable election machinery to deliver and track doses to recipients in far corners of the country. It is also likely to use digital platforms and apps to enable people to register for the doses.\n\nHowever, not every Indian owns a smart phone or knows how to operate an app, so it will be interesting to see what the government does to make sure that there are no inadvertent exclusions.\n\nVaccine hesitancy is the other concern.\n\nHealth activists Seema Pal and Rama Negi say they have been busting misinformation about the vaccine\n\nThe recent controversy over the hurried approval of Covaxin, many feel, could undermine confidence. There's a history of hesitancy about receiving the polio vaccine in parts of northern India, triggered by rumours about vaccines being impure and affecting fertility. Similar disinformation is now circulating about Covid vaccines on social networking apps, such as WhatsApp.\n\nThe government will need consistent, clear-eyed communication to bolster vaccine acceptance and community perception of the programme.\n\nVaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such \"adverse events\" following immunisation.\n\nBut researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines.",

This information will help our contact tracing efforts to track and limit the spread of the virus.\n\n\"We are continuing to work closely with our colleagues to respond to this situation and to ensure there is support in place for students should they need it.\"\n\nLast week St Andrews University in Fife said it was dealing with a \"sudden and significant\" rise in Covid cases among students, with more than 40 self-isolating.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "All coastal towns in England will be eligible for government funding to help them reopen as restrictions are eased, under new plans set out by ministers.\n\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the \u00a356m fund would also \"spruce up\" high streets and help councils welcome visitors back safely.\n\nPubs can put up marquees in their gardens for longer and there will be a crackdown on \"cowboy parking firms\".\n\nLabour said it was a \"drop in the ocean\" in terms of what areas needed.\n\nEngland's current \"stay at home\" regulations are expected to be lifted on 29 March, with most restrictions eased in various steps by the 21 June, based on certain conditions being met at each stage.\n\nAnnouncing the latest tranche of funding, Mr Jenrick acknowledged it had been \"an incredibly difficult period for retail and hospitality\".\n\nHe said the government would do everything it could to help businesses reopen safely.\n\nThere has been concern about how coastal areas in particular will cope with an expected influx of visitors.\n\nWhen the first lockdown was eased last June, seaside resorts were gridlocked, with Bournemouth declaring a \"major incident\" as people flocked to the beach.\n\nMr Jenrick said that this time, \u00a36m of the \u00a356m Welcome Back fund would be specifically allocated to support coastal areas.\n\nThe remaining \u00a350m will be distributed by central government to councils for things such as improving green spaces and providing more outdoor seating areas, markets and food pop-ups.\n\nHe also announced the government would be \"cutting red tape\" to allow pubs to erect marquees in their gardens for \"the whole of the spring and summer\", rather than the 28 days currently permitted, so people can meet up with their family and friends \"whatever the weather\".\n\nAnd in a bid to attract more shoppers to the high street, ministers have announced a crackdown on cowboy parking firms.\n\nThere will be a new appeals process to try to curb unfair tickets and caps will be introduced on private parking fines.\n\nThe struggles of the hospitality sector amid multiple lockdowns have been well documented. And the independent retailers' trade body Bira says the past 12 months have been the worst of its members' lives - with crucial in-person Easter and pre-Christmas trade lost.\n\nOnce non-essential shops can open again, from 12 April in England, any help to attract people back will no doubt be welcome. Businesses will want to make the most of pent-up demand in a safe way.\n\nThe same goes for hospitality. While social distancing will still be in place at least to start with, maximising outdoor space will be crucial for venues which have it - especially during the first phase of their reopening when only outdoor service will be permitted.\n\nPackages like these for high streets and towns won't fix the long-term challenges facing town centres: shoppers going online, leaving big high street stores increasingly empty. Some customers have grown so used to internet shopping during a year of lockdowns that the habit will stick.\n\nThe hope will be, however, to make this a summer to remember after a winter to forget.\n\nGovernment officials say this will \"give drivers more confidence in heading into town knowing they won't be unfairly penalised by rogue operators\".\n\nMr Jenrick said: \"As we move to the next stage on the road map out of lockdown, we are all looking forward to being reunited with friends and family outdoors and making a safe and happy return to our favourite shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants.\n\n\"Our Welcome Back Fund gives every city, town and high street support to prepare for a great summer. This funding will help councils and businesses to welcome shoppers, diners and tourists back safely.\n\n\"As soon as the road map allows, we need to get behind our local businesses and enjoy all that this country has to offer and that we've been missing so much.\"\n\nBut Labour has accused the Conservatives of presiding over \"decades of decline\".\n\nThe shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: \"This is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much the Conservatives took away over a decade when they pushed our high streets and seaside towns into deep decline - and it's not clear which areas will benefit.\n\n\"The Conservatives have done nothing to level the playing field between high street shops and online retailers. Now they want to hollow high streets out by selling off temporarily closed shops to wealthy developers so they can never reopen as shops again. \"",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "Bill Nelson: Former astronaut and senator nominated as Nasa chief\n\nBill Nelson on the campaign trail in Florida during the 2018 mid-term elections\n\nBill Nelson, a US senator and one-time astronaut, has been nominated to be the next head of Nasa.\n\nThe 78-year-old is seen as a moderate Democrat, and his nomination by President Joe Biden on Friday drew bipartisan praise.\n\nHe will need to be confirmed in the Senate before he can take up the role.\n\nMr Nelson said he was \"honoured\" to be picked to lead the US space agency, adding that he would \"help lead Nasa into an exciting future\".\n\nIn a statement, the White House said he was \"known as the go-to senator for our nation's space programme\" for many years. \"Almost every piece of space and science law has had his imprint,\" it said.\n\nThe Republican Senator from Florida, Marco Rubio, said: \"I cannot think of anyone better to lead Nasa.\"\n\nIn a statement, Mr Nelson said Nasa's workforce \"radiates optimism, ingenuity and a can-do spirit.\" He added: \"The Nasa team continues to achieve the seemingly impossible as we venture into the cosmos.\"\n\nMr Nelson was a driving force behind Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which was conceived in the wake of an Obama-era overhaul of the US space programme.\n\nHe will succeed Jim Bridenstine, who led the agency for almost three years under the Trump administration.\n\nMr Bridenstine earned widespread praise for his efforts to promote Nasa programmes - in particular, its Artemis venture, which will see astronauts return to the Moon in the 2020s before mounting a mission to Mars.\n\n\"Bill Nelson is an excellent pick for Nasa Administrator,\" Mr Bridenstine said, adding that the former Florida senator had the \"political clout\" to collaborate with different government offices as well as members of Congress.\n\n\"He has the diplomatic skills to lead an international coalition sustainably to the Moon and on to Mars,\" he said. \"The Senate should confirm Bill Nelson without delay.\"\n\nMr Nelson was among those who initially criticised Mr Bridenstine's confirmation in 2018, saying: \"The administrator must be a leader who has the ability to bring us together... on a shared vision for future space exploration.\"\n\nThe Oklahoma Congressman had no formal qualifications in science and engineering, and there were concerns he would politicise the non-partisan agency.\n\nBut following Mr Bridenstine's successful tenure at Nasa, the Biden administration has opted to appoint another politician as the agency's head - albeit a former astronaut with a long history of working on space issues.\n\nMr Nelson served in Florida's state legislature during the 1970s, representing the district that's home to Nasa's Kennedy Space Center.\n\nAfter his election to the House of Representatives in 1978, he became the second sitting member of Congress to travel into space when he flew as a payload specialist aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1986.\n\nAfter he won election to the Senate in Florida in 2000, Mr Nelson continued to be closely involved in formulating space policy.\n\nIn 2010, he said he believed President Barack Obama had \"made a mistake\" by cancelling the Constellation programme. That programme was former President George W Bush's effort to return astronauts to the Moon.\n\nThe decision to axe Constellation - which, at the time, was over budget and behind schedule - sparked a backlash in Congress, not least because it jeopardised thousands of space jobs in southern states.\n\nNelson unveils the design of the SLS in 2011, as then-Nasa chief Charles Bolden looks on\n\nAlong with a Republican Senator for Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mr Nelson insisted that Nasa be mandated to build a new heavy-lift rocket in the agency's 2010 Authorization Act.\n\nThe SLS gave Nasa the capability to launch its Orion crew vehicle to the Moon and other deep space destinations, while securing a base of engineering expertise across the south.\n\nBut the programme was criticised by those who believed the agency should move to launching spacecraft entirely on commercial rockets, like those built by Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\n\nMr Nelson lost his last re-election bid and his Senate term ended in 2019.\n\nIn a statement, the acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk, said: \"Bill has a proven history of supporting our work here at Nasa, and has helped advance America's position in human exploration, science, aeronautics, and technology.\"",

            "content": "Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has tested positive for Covid-19, the country's health minister has said.\n\nThe 68-year-old is \"self-isolating at home\", the minister, Faisal Sultan, tweeted.\n\nMr Khan, a former captain of the national cricket team who became prime minister in August 2018, received his first vaccination two days ago.\n\nPakistan has recorded 13,799 deaths and 623,135 cases during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nVaccination helps develop immunity to the virus that causes Covid-19 but it usually takes a few weeks for protection to develop, and the person getting the jab remains vulnerable during that time.\n\nThe prime minister has been attending regular meetings, including at a security conference in the capital Islamabad that was attended by a large number of people, Reuters news agency notes.\n\nHe addressed that conference without wearing a mask, and attended another gathering to inaugurate a housing project for poor people on Friday, the agency reports.\n\nImran Khan was tested for coronavirus after developing a \"slight cough\", according to one of his senior advisers, and he now has a mild fever.\n\nHe received his first dose of the Chinese-produced Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday. The former cricketing superstar is generally in good health, and his adviser described him as remaining \"hale and hearty.\"\n\nVaccine hesitancy has been a major concern in Pakistan, and the prime minister's decision to broadcast footage of himself receiving the jab was praised as an attempt to encourage others to do the same. It seems certain Mr Khan had already been infected prior to the vaccination, but there are fears the episode will boost vaccine scepticism.\n\nPartial lockdown restrictions have recently been reintroduced in parts of the country following a rise in cases.\n\nPakistan began vaccinations for the general public on 10 March, starting with elderly people.\n\nAlong with Sinopharm, the country has approved the CanSinoBio, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccines for emergency use.",
